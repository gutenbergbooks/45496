<p>The proprietors of this interesting work having felt that
much additional knowledge of the subject has been obtained
since the book was written, have asked me to supply characteristic
examples of Insect Architecture which were not to
be found in its pages. I have accordingly added a considerable
number of such examples, in most cases accompanied
by figures drawn from the specimens described. I
have not been at liberty to alter or expunge, and am not,
therefore, responsible for any portion of the letterpress
except those passages which are enclosed in brackets [&nbsp; &nbsp;].
Some of the specimens from which the figures have been
drawn are in my own collection, but the greater part are to
be found in the British Museum.</p>

<p>It can never be too strongly impressed upon a mind anxious
for the acquisition of knowledge, that the commonest
things by which we are surrounded are deserving of minute
and careful attention. The most profound investigations of
Philosophy are necessarily connected with the ordinary
circumstances of our being, and of the world in which our
every-day life is spent. With regard to our own existence,
the pulsation of the heart, the act of respiration, the voluntary
movement of our limbs, the condition of sleep, are
among the most ordinary operations of our nature; and yet
how long were the wisest of men struggling with dark and
bewildering speculations before they could offer anything
like a satisfactory solution of these phenomena, and how far
are we still from an accurate and complete knowledge of
them! The science of Meteorology, which attempts to
explain to us the philosophy of matters constantly before our
eyes, as dew, mist, and rain, is dependent for its illustrations
upon a knowledge of the most complicated facts, such as the
influence of heat and electricity upon the air; and this
knowledge is at present so imperfect, that even these common
occurrences of the weather, which men have been observing
and reasoning upon for ages, are by no means satisfactorily
explained, or reduced to the precision that every science
should aspire to. Yet, however difficult it may be entirely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
to comprehend the phenomena we daily witness, everything
in nature is full of instruction. Thus the humblest flower
of the field, although, to one whose curiosity has not been
excited, and whose understanding has, therefore, remained
uninformed, it may appear worthless and contemptible, is
valuable to the botanist, not only with regard to its place
in the arrangement of this portion of the Creator&rsquo;s works,
but as it leads his mind forward to the consideration
of those beautiful provisions for the support of vegetable
life, which it is the part of the physiologist to study and to
admire.</p>

<p>This train of reasoning is peculiarly applicable to the
economy of insects. They constitute a very large and
interesting part of the animal kingdom. They are everywhere
about us. The spider weaves his curious web in our
houses; the caterpillar constructs his silken cell in our
gardens; the wasp that hovers over our food has a nest not
far removed from us, which she has assisted to build with the
nicest art; the beetle that crawls across our path is also an
ingenious and laborious mechanic, and has some curious
instincts to exhibit to those who will feel an interest in
watching his movements; and the moth that eats into our
clothes has something to plead for our pity, for he came,
like us, naked into the world, and he has destroyed our
garments, not in malice or wantonness, but that he may
clothe himself with the same wool which we have stripped
from the sheep. An observation of the habits of these little
creatures is full of valuable lessons, which the abundance of
the examples has no tendency to diminish. The more such
observations are multiplied, the more are we led forward to
the freshest and the most delightful parts of knowledge; the
more do we learn to estimate rightly the extraordinary provisions
and most abundant resources of a creative Providence;
and the better do we appreciate our own relations
with all the infinite varieties of nature, and our dependence,
in common with the ephemeron that flutters its little hour
in the summer sun, upon that Being in whose scheme of
existence the humblest as well as the highest creature has its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
destined purposes. &ldquo;If you speak of a stone,&rdquo; says St. Basil,
one of the Fathers of the Church, &ldquo;if you speak of a fly, a
gnat, or a bee, your conversation will be a sort of demonstration
of His power whose hand formed them, for the wisdom
of the workman is commonly perceived in that which is of
little size. He who has stretched out the heavens, and
dug up the bottom of the sea, is also He who has pierced a
passage through the sting of the bee for the ejection of its
poison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If it be granted that making discoveries is one of the most
satisfactory of human pleasures, then we may without hesitation
affirm, that the study of insects is one of the most
delightful branches of natural history, for it affords peculiar
facilities for its pursuit. These facilities are found in the
almost inexhaustible variety which insects present to the
curious observer. As a proof of the extraordinary number of
insects within a limited field of observation, Mr. Stephens
informs us, that in the short space of forty days, between the
middle of June and the beginning of August, he found, in
the vicinity of Ripley, specimens of above two thousand four
hundred species of insects, exclusive of caterpillars and grubs,&mdash;a
number amounting to nearly a fourth of the insects
ascertained to be indigenous. He further tells us, that,
among these specimens, although the ground had, in former
seasons, been frequently explored, there were about one
hundred species altogether new, and not before in any
collection which he had inspected, including several new
genera; while many insects reputed scarce were in considerable
plenty.[A]<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A"></a><a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> The localities of insects are, to a certain
extent, constantly changing; and thus the study of them has,
in this circumstance, as well as in their manifold abundance,
a source of perpetual variety. Insects, also, which are
plentiful one year, frequently become scarce, or disappear
altogether, the next&mdash;a fact strikingly illustrated by the
uncommon abundance, in 1826 and 1827, of the seven-spot
lady-bird (<i>Coccinella septempunctata</i>), in the vicinity of London,
though during the two succeeding summers this insect was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
comparatively scarce, while the small two-spot lady-bird
(<i>Coccinella bipunctata</i>) was plentiful.</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, no situation in which the lover of
nature and the observer of animal life may not find opportunities
for increasing his store of facts. It is told of a
state prisoner, under a cruel and rigorous despotism, that
when he was excluded from all commerce with mankind, and
was shut out from books, he took an interest and found
consolation in the visits of a spider; and there is no
improbability in the story. The operations of that persecuted
creature are among the most extraordinary exhibitions
of mechanical ingenuity; and a daily watching of the
workings of its instinct would beget admiration in a rightly-constituted
mind. The poor prisoner had abundant leisure
for the speculations in which the spider&rsquo;s web would enchain
his understanding. We have all of us, at one period or
other of our lives, been struck with some singular evidence
of contrivance in the economy of insects, which we have
seen with our own eyes. Want of leisure, and probably
want of knowledge, have prevented us from following up the
curiosity which for a moment was excited. And yet some
such accident has made men naturalists, in the highest
meaning of the term. Bonnet, evidently speaking of himself,
says, &ldquo;I knew a naturalist, who, when he was seventeen years
of age, having heard of the operations of the ant-lion, began
by doubting them. He had no rest till he had examined into
them: and he verified them, he admired them, he discovered
new facts, and soon became the disciple and the friend of the
Pliny of France&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_B" id="FNanchor_B"></a><a href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> (Réaumur). It is not the happy fortune
of many to be able to devote themselves exclusively to the
study of nature, unquestionably the most fascinating of
human employments; but almost every one may acquire
sufficient knowledge to be able to derive a high gratification
from beholding the more common operations of animal life.
His materials for contemplation are always before him.
Some weeks ago we made an excursion to West Wood, near
Shooter&rsquo;s Hill, expressly for the purpose of observing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
insects we might meet with in the wood: but we had not
got far among the bushes, when heavy rain came on. We
immediately sought shelter among the boughs of some thick
underwood, composed of oak, birch, and aspen; but we
could not meet with a single insect, not even a gnat or a fly,
sheltered under the leaves. Upon looking more narrowly,
however, into the bushes which protected us, we soon found
a variety of interesting objects of study. The oak abounded
in galls, several of them quite new to us; while the leaves
of the birch and the aspen exhibited the curious serpentine
paths of the minute mining caterpillars. When we had
exhausted the narrow field of observation immediately around
us, we found that we could considerably extend it, by breaking
a few of the taller branches near us, and then examining
their leaves at leisure. In this manner two hours glided
quickly and pleasantly away, by which time the rain had
nearly ceased; and though we had been disappointed in our
wish to ramble through the wood, we did not return without
adding a few interesting facts to our previous knowledge of
insect economy.<a name="FNanchor_C" id="FNanchor_C"></a><a href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>It will appear, then, from the preceding observations,
that cabinets and collections, though undoubtedly of the
highest use, are by no means indispensable, as the observer
of nature may find inexhaustible subjects of study in every
garden and in every hedge. Nature has been profuse
enough in affording us materials for observation, when we
are prepared to look about us with that keenness of inquiry,
which curiosity, the first step in the pursuit of knowledge,
will unquestionably give. Nor shall we be disappointed
in the gratification which is thus within our reach. Were
it no more, indeed, than a source of agreeable amusement,
the study of insects comes strongly recommended to the
notice of the well-educated. The pleasures of childhood
are generally supposed to be more exquisite, and to contain
less alloy, than those of riper years; and if so, it must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
because then everything appears new and dressed in fresh
beauties: while in manhood, and old age, whatever has
frequently recurred begins to wear the tarnish of decay.
The study of nature affords us a succession of &ldquo;ever-new
delights,&rdquo; such as charmed us in childhood, when everything
had the attractions of novelty and beauty; and thus
the mind of the naturalist may have its own fresh and
vigorous thoughts, even while the infirmities of age weigh
down the body.</p>

<p>It has been objected to the study of insects, as well as
to that of Natural History in general, that it tends to withdraw
the mind from subjects of higher moment; that it
cramps and narrows the range of thought; and that it
destroys, or at least weakens, the finer creations of the
fancy. Now, we should allow this objection in its fullest
extent, and even be disposed to carry it further than is
usually done, if the collecting of specimens only, or, as the
French expressly call them, chips (<i>échantillons</i>), be called a
study. But the mere collector is not, and cannot be, justly
considered as a naturalist; and, taking the term naturalist
in its enlarged sense, we can adduce some distinguished
instances in opposition to the objection. Rousseau, for
example, was passionately fond of the Linnæan botany,
even to the driest minutiæ of its technicalities; and yet it
does not appear to have cramped his mind, or impoverished
his imagination. If Rousseau, however, be objected to as
an eccentric being, from whose pursuits no fair inference
can be drawn, we give the illustrious example of Charles
James Fox, and may add the names of our distinguished
poets, Goldsmith, Thomson, Gray, and Darwin, who were
all enthusiastic naturalists. We wish particularly to insist
upon the example of Gray, because he was very partial
to the study of insects. It may be new to many of our
readers, who are familiar with the &lsquo;Elegy in a Country
Churchyard,&rsquo; to be told that its author was at the pains to
turn the characteristics of the Linnæan orders of insects
into Latin hexameters, the manuscript of which is still
preserved in his interleaved copy of the &lsquo;Systema Naturæ.&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Further, to use the somewhat exaggerated words of Kirby
and Spence, whose work on Entomology is one of the most
instructive and pleasing books on the science, 'Aristotle
among the Greeks, and Pliny the Elder among the Romans,
may be denominated the fathers of Natural History, as well
as the greatest philosophers of their day; yet both these
made insects a principal object of their attention: and in
more recent times, if we look abroad, what names greater
than those of Redi, Malpighi, Vallisnieri, Swammerdam,
Leeuwenhoek, Réaumur, Linnæus, De Geer, Bonnet, and
the Hubers? and at home, what philosophers have done
more honour to their country and to human nature than
Ray, Willughby, Lister, and Derham? Yet all these made
the study of insects one of their most favourite
pursuits."<a name="FNanchor_D" id="FNanchor_D"></a><a href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>And yet this study has been considered, by those who
have superficially examined the subject, as belonging to a
small order of minds; and the satire of Pope has been
indiscriminately applied to all collectors, while, in truth, it
only touches those who mistake the means of knowledge
for the end:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O! would the sons of men once think their eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reason given them but to study Flies!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See Nature, in some partial, narrow shape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let the Author of the whole escape;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Learn but to trifle; or, who most observe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wonder at their Maker, not to serve."<a name="FNanchor_E" id="FNanchor_E"></a><a href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">[E]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus exclaims the Goddess of Dulness, sweeping into her
net all those who study nature in detail. But if the matter
were rightly appreciated, it would be evident that no part
of the works of the Creator can be without the deepest
interest to an inquiring mind; and that a portion of creation
which exhibits such extraordinary manifestations of design
as is shown by insects must have attractions for the very
highest understanding.</p>

<p>An accurate knowledge of the properties of insects is
of great importance to man, merely with relation to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
own comfort and security. The injuries which they inflict
upon us are extensive and complicated; and the remedies
which we attempt, by the destruction of those creatures,
both insects, birds, and quadrupeds, who keep the ravages
in check, are generally aggravations of the evil, because
they are directed by an ignorance of the economy of nature.
The little knowledge which we have of the modes by which
insects may be impeded in their destruction of much that
is valuable to us, has probably proceeded from our contempt
of their individual insignificance. The security of property
has ceased to be endangered by quadrupeds of prey, and
yet our gardens are ravaged by aphides and caterpillars.
It is somewhat startling to affirm that the condition of the
human race is seriously injured by these petty annoyances;
but it is perfectly true that the art and industry of man
have not yet been able to overcome the collective force, the
individual perseverance, and the complicated machinery of
destruction which insects employ. A small ant, according
to a most careful and philosophical observer, opposes almost
invincible obstacles to the progress of civilization in many
parts of the equinoctial zone. These animals devour paper
and parchment; they destroy every book and manuscript.
Many provinces of Spanish America cannot, in consequence,
show a written document of a hundred years&rsquo; existence.
&ldquo;What development,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;can the civilization of a
people assume, if there be nothing to connect the present
with the past&mdash;if the depositories of human knowledge must
be constantly renewed&mdash;if the monuments of genius and
wisdom cannot be transmitted to posterity?&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_F" id="FNanchor_F"></a><a href="#Footnote_F" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> Again, there
are beetles which deposit their larvæ in trees in such formidable
numbers that whole forests perish beyond the power
of remedy. The pines of the Hartz have thus been destroyed
to an enormous extent; and in North America, at
one place in South Carolina, at least ninety trees in every
hundred, upon a tract of two thousand acres, were swept
away by a small black, winged bug. And yet, according
to Wilson, the historian of American birds, the people of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the United States were in the habit of destroying the redheaded
woodpecker, the great enemy of these insects,
because he occasionally spoilt an apple.<a name="FNanchor_G" id="FNanchor_G"></a><a href="#Footnote_G" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> The same delightful
writer and true naturalist, speaking of the labours of
the ivory-billed woodpecker, says, &ldquo;Would it be believed
that the larvæ of an insect or fly, no larger than a grain
of rice, should silently, and in one season, destroy some
thousand acres of pine-trees, many of them from two to
three feet in diameter, and a hundred and fifty feet high?
In some places the whole woods, as far as you can see
around you, are dead, stripped of the bark, their wintry-looking
arms and bare trunks bleaching in the sun, and
tumbling in ruins before every blast.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_H" id="FNanchor_H"></a><a href="#Footnote_H" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> The subterraneous
larva of some species of beetle has often caused a complete
failure of the seed-corn, as in the district of Halle in
1812.<a name="FNanchor_I" id="FNanchor_I"></a><a href="#Footnote_I" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> The corn-weevil, which extracts the flour from
grain, leaving the husk behind, will destroy the contents
of the largest storehouses in a very short period. The
wire-worm and the turnip-fly are dreaded by every farmer.
The ravages of the locust are too well known not to be at
once recollected as an example of the formidable collective
power of the insect race. The white ants of tropical
countries sweep away whole villages with as much certainty
as a fire or an inundation; and ships even have been
destroyed by these indefatigable republics. Our own docks
and embankments have been threatened by such minute
ravagers.</p>

<p>The enormous injuries which insects cause to man may
thus be held as one reason for ceasing to consider the study
of them as an insignificant pursuit; for a knowledge of their
structure, their food, their enemies, and their general habits,
may lead, as it often has led, to the means of guarding
against their injuries. At the same time we derive from
them both direct and indirect benefits. The honey of the
bee, the dye of the cochineal, and the web of the silk-worm,
the advantages of which are obvious, may well be balanced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
against the destructive propensities of insects which are
offensive to man. But a philosophical study of natural
history will teach us that the direct benefits which insects
confer upon us are even less important than their general
uses in maintaining the economy of the world. The mischiefs
which result to us from the rapid increase and the
activity of insects are merely results of the very principle by
which they confer upon us numberless indirect advantages.
Forests are swept away by minute beetles; but the same
agencies relieve us from that extreme abundance of vegetable
matter which would render the earth uninhabitable were
this excess not periodically destroyed. In hot countries the
great business of removing corrupt animal matter, which the
vulture and hyæna imperfectly perform, is effected with
certainty and speed by the myriads of insects that spring
from the eggs deposited in every carcase by some fly seeking
therein the means of life for her progeny. Destruction and
reproduction, the great laws of nature, are carried on very
greatly through the instrumentality of insects; and the same
principle regulates even the increase of particular species of
insects themselves. When aphides are so abundant that we
know not how to escape their ravages, flocks of lady-birds
instantly cover our fields and gardens to destroy them.
Such considerations as these are thrown out to show that
the subject of insects has a great philosophical importance&mdash;and
what portion of the works of nature has not? The
habits of all God&rsquo;s creatures, whether they are noxious, or
harmless, or beneficial, are worthy objects of our study. If
they affect ourselves, in our health or our possessions, whether
for good or for evil, an additional impulse is naturally given
to our desire to attain a knowledge of their properties. Such
studies form one of the most interesting occupations which
can engage a rational and inquisitive mind; and, perhaps,
none of the employments of human life are more dignified
than the investigation and survey of the workings and the
ways of nature in the minutest of her productions.</p>

<p>The exercise of that habit of observation which can alone
make a naturalist&mdash;&ldquo;an out-of-door naturalist,&rdquo; as Daines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Barrington calls himself&mdash;is well calculated to strengthen
even the most practical and merely useful powers of the
mind. One of the most valuable mental acquirements is
the power of discriminating among things which differ in
many minute points, but whose general similarity of appearance
usually deceives the common observer into a belief of
their identity. The study of insects, in this point of view,
is most peculiarly adapted for youth. According to our
experience, it is exceedingly difficult for persons arrived at
manhood to acquire this power of discrimination; but, in
early life, a little care on the part of the parent or teacher
will render it comparatively easy. In this study the knowledge
of things should go along with that of words. &ldquo;If
names perish,&rdquo; says Linnæus, &ldquo;the knowledge of things
perishes also:&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_J" id="FNanchor_J"></a><a href="#Footnote_J" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> and, without names, how can any one communicate
to another the knowledge he has acquired relative
to any particular fact, either of physiology, habit, utility, or
locality? On the other hand, mere catalogue learning
is as much to be rejected as the loose generalizations
of the despisers of classification and nomenclature.
To name a plant, or an insect, or a bird, or a quadruped
rightly, is one step towards an accurate knowledge of it;
but it is not the knowledge itself. It is the means,
and not the end in natural history, as in every other
science.</p>

<p>If the bias of opening curiosity be properly directed, there
is not any branch of natural history so fascinating to youth
as the study of insects. It is, indeed, a common practice in
many families to teach children, from their earliest infancy,
to treat the greater number of insects as if they were
venomous and dangerous, and, of course, meriting to be
destroyed, or at least avoided with horror. Associations
are by this means linked with the very appearance of
insects, which become gradually more inveterate with advancing
years; provided, as most frequently happens, the
same system be persisted in, of avoiding or destroying almost
every insect which is unlucky enough to attract observation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
How much rational amusement and innocent pleasure is thus
thoughtlessly lost; and how many disagreeable feelings are
thus created, in the most absurd manner! In order to show
that the study or (if the word be disliked) the observation of
insects is peculiarly fascinating to children, even in their
early infancy, we may refer to what we have seen in the
family of a friend, who is partial to this, as well as to all
the departments of natural history. Our friend&rsquo;s children,
a boy and girl, were taught, from the moment they could
distinguish insects, to treat them as objects of interest and
curiosity, and not to be afraid even of those which wore the
most repulsive appearance. The little girl, for example,
when just beginning to walk alone, encountered one day a
large staphylinus (<i>Goërius olens?</i> <span class="smcap">Stephens</span>; vulgo, <i>the devil&rsquo;s
coach-horse</i>), which she fearlessly seized, and did not quit her
hold, though the insect grasped one of her fingers in his
formidable jaws. The mother, who was by, knew enough
of the insect to be rather alarmed for the consequences,
though she prudently concealed her feelings from the child.
She did well; for the insect was not strong enough to break
the skin, and the child took no notice of its attempts to bite
her finger. A whole series of disagreeable associations with
this formidable-looking family of insects was thus averted at
the very moment when a different mode of acting on the part
of the mother would have produced the contrary effect. For
more than two years after this occurrence the little girl and
her brother assisted in adding numerous specimens to their
father&rsquo;s collection, without the parents ever having cause,
from any accident, to repent of their employing themselves
in this manner. The sequel of the little girl&rsquo;s history
strikingly illustrates the position for which we contend.
The child happened to be sent to a relative in the country,
where she was not long in having carefully instilled into her
mind all the usual antipathies against &ldquo;everything that
creepeth on the earth;&rdquo; and though she afterwards returned
to her paternal home, no persuasion or remonstrance could
ever again persuade her to touch a common beetle, much less
a staphylinus, with its tail turned up in a threatening attitude,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and its formidable jaws ready extended for attack or defence.<a name="FNanchor_K" id="FNanchor_K"></a><a href="#Footnote_K" class="fnanchor">[K]</a>
We do not wish that children should be encouraged to expose
themselves to danger in their encounters with insects. They
should be taught to avoid those few which are really noxious&mdash;to
admire all&mdash;to injure none.</p>

<p>The various beauty of insects&mdash;their glittering colours,
their graceful forms&mdash;supplies an inexhaustible source of
attraction. Even the most formidable insects, both in appearance
and reality,&mdash;the dragon-fly, which is perfectly
harmless to man, and the wasp, whose sting every human
being almost instinctively shuns,&mdash;are splendid in their appearance,
and are painted with all the brilliancy of natural
hues. It has been remarked that the plumage of tropical
birds is not superior in vivid colouring to what may be
observed in the greater number of butterflies and moths.<a name="FNanchor_L" id="FNanchor_L"></a><a href="#Footnote_L" class="fnanchor">[L]</a>
&ldquo;See,&rdquo; exclaims Linnæus, &ldquo;the large, elegant painted wings
of the butterfly, four in number, covered with delicate feathery
scales! With these it sustains itself in the air a whole day,
rivalling the flight of birds and the brilliancy of the peacock.
Consider this insect through the wonderful progress of its
life,&mdash;how different is the first period of its being from the
second, and both from the parent insect! Its changes are
an inexplicable enigma to us: we see a green caterpillar,
furnished with sixteen feet, feeding upon the leaves of a
plant; this is changed into a chrysalis, smooth, of golden
lustre, hanging suspended to a fixed point, without feet, and
subsisting without food; this insect again undergoes another
transformation, acquires wings, and six feet, and becomes a
gay butterfly, sporting in the air, and living by suction upon
the honey of plants. What has nature produced more worthy
of our admiration than such an animal, coming upon the stage
of the world, and playing its part there under so many different
masks?&rdquo; The ancients were so struck with the transformations
of the butterfly, and its revival from a seeming
temporary death, as to have considered it an emblem of the
soul, the Greek word <i>pysche</i> signifying both the soul and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
butterfly; and it is for this reason that we find the butterfly
introduced into their allegorical sculptures as an emblem of
immortality. Trifling, therefore, and perhaps contemptible,
as to the unthinking may seem the study of a butterfly, yet
when we consider the art and mechanism displayed in so
minute a structure,&mdash;the fluids circulating in vessels so
small as almost to escape the sight&mdash;the beauty of the
wings and covering&mdash;and the manner in which each part is
adapted for its peculiar functions,&mdash;we cannot but be struck
with wonder and admiration, and allow, with Paley, that
&ldquo;the production of beauty was as much in the Creator&rsquo;s
mind in painting a butterfly as in giving symmetry to the
human form.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A collection of insects is to the true naturalist what a
collection of medals is to the accurate student of history.
The mere collector, who looks only to the shining wings
of the one, or the green rust of the other, derives little
knowledge from his pursuit. But the cabinet of the
naturalist becomes rich in the most interesting subjects of
contemplation, when he regards it in the genuine spirit of
scientific inquiry. What, for instance, can be so delightful
as to examine the wonderful variety of structure in this
portion of the creation; and, above all, to trace the beautiful
gradations by which one species runs into another?
Their differences are so minute, that an unpractised eye
would proclaim their identity; and yet, when the species
are separated, and not very distantly, they become visible
even to the common observer. It is in examinations such
as these that the naturalist finds a delight of the highest
order. While it is thus one of the legitimate objects of his
study to attend to minute differences of structure, form, and
colouring, he is not less interested in the investigation of
habits and economy; and in this respect the insect world
is inexhaustibly rich. We find herein examples of instinct
to parallel those of all the larger animals, whether they
are solitary or social; and innumerable others besides, altogether
unlike those manifested in the superior departments
of animated nature. These instincts have various directions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and are developed in a more or less striking manner to
our senses, according to the force of the motive by which
they are governed. Some of their instincts have for their
object the preservation of insects from external attack; some
have reference to procuring food, and involve many remarkable
stratagems; some direct their social economy, and
regulate the condition under which they live together either
in monarchies or republics, their colonizations, and their
migrations; but the most powerful instinct which belongs
to insects has regard to the preservation of their species.
We find, accordingly, that as the necessity for this preservation
is of the utmost importance in the economy of nature,
so for this especial object many insects, whose offspring,
whether in the egg or the larva state, are peculiarly exposed
to danger, are endued with an almost miraculous foresight,
and with an ingenuity, perseverance, and unconquerable
industry, for the purpose of avoiding those dangers, which
are not to be paralleled even by the most singular efforts of
human contrivance. The same ingenuity which is employed
for protecting either eggs, or caterpillars and grubs, or pupæ
and chrysalides, is also exercised by many insects for their
own preservation against the changes of temperature to
which they are exposed, or against their natural enemies.
Many species employ those contrivances during the period
of their hibernation, or winter sleep. For all these purposes
some dig holes in the earth, and form them into cells; others
build nests of extraneous substances, such as bits of wood
and leaves; others roll up leaves into cases, which they close
with the most curious art; others build a house of mud,
and line it with the cotton of trees, or the petals of the most
delicate flowers; others construct cells, of secretions from
their own bodies; others form cocoons, in which they
undergo their transformation; and others dig subterraneous
galleries, which, in their complexity of arrangement, in
solidity, and in complete adaptation to their purposes, vie
with the cities of civilised man. The contrivances by which
insects effect these objects have been accurately observed
and minutely described, by patient and philosophical inquirers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
who knew that such employments of the instinct
with which each species is endowed by its Creator offered
the most valuable and instructive lessons, and opened to
them a wide field of the most delightful study. The construction
of their habitations is certainly among the most
remarkable peculiarities in the economy of insects; and it is
of this subject that we propose to treat under the general
name, which is sufficiently applicable to our purpose, of
<span class="smcap">Insect Architecture</span>.</p>

<p>In the descriptions which we shall give of Insect Architecture,
we shall employ as few technical words as possible:
and such as we cannot well avoid, we shall explain in their
places; but, since our subject chiefly relates to the reproduction
of insects, it may be useful to many readers to introduce
here a brief description of the changes which they undergo.</p>

<p>It was of old believed that insects were produced spontaneously
by putrefying substances; and Virgil gives the
details of a process for <i>creating</i> a swarm of bees out of the
carcase of a bull; but Redi, a celebrated Italian naturalist,
proved by rigid experiments that they are always, in such
cases, hatched from <i>eggs</i> previously laid. Most insects,
indeed, lay eggs, though some few are viviparous, and some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
propagate both ways. The eggs of insects are very various
in form, and seldom shaped like those of birds. We have
here figured those of several species, as they appear under
the microscope.</p>

<p>When an insect first issues from the egg, it is called by
naturalists <i>larva</i>, and, popularly, a caterpillar, a grub, or a
maggot. The distinction, in popular language, seems to be,
that <i>caterpillars</i> are produced from the eggs of moths or
butterflies; <i>grubs</i> from the eggs of beetles, bees, wasps, &amp;c.;
and <i>maggots</i> (which are without feet) from blow-flies, house-flies,
cheese-flies, &amp;c., though this is not very rigidly adhered
to in common parlance. Maggots are also sometimes called
<i>worms</i>, as in the instance of the meal-worm; but the common
earth-worm is not a larva, nor is it by modern naturalists
ranked among insects.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 435px;">

<i>c</i>, larva of the poplar beetle (<i>Chrysomela populi</i>); <i>d</i>, larva of Sinex; <i>e</i>, larva of the
common gnat.</div>
</div>

<p>There are, however, certain larvæ, as those of the Cicada,
the crickets, the water-boatman (<i>Notonecta</i>), the cockroach,
&amp;c., which resemble the perfect insects in form,
excepting that they are destitute of wings; but in the pupa
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
state these appear in a rudimentary condition, at least in
such species as have wings in the mature stage of existence.
The pupæ are active and eat. Insects, the larvæ and pupæ
of which are so similar to the adults, are termed <i>Ametabolous</i>
(<i>a</i>, without, [Greek: metabolê], change); those the larvæ of which
undergo changes of a marked character, <i>Metabolous</i> (<i>Insecta
ametabola</i> and <i>Insecta metabola</i>, Burmeister).</p>

<p>Larvæ are remarkably small at first, but grow rapidly.
The full-grown caterpillar of the goat-moth (<i>Cossus ligniperda</i>)
is thus seventy-two thousand times heavier than when
it issues from the egg; and the maggot of the blow-fly is, in
twenty-four hours, one hundred and fifty-five times heavier
than at its birth. Some larvæ have feet, others are without;
none have wings. They cannot propagate. They feed
voraciously on coarse substances; and as they increase in
size, which they do very rapidly, they cast their skins three
or four times. In defending themselves from injury, and in
preparing for their change by the construction of secure
abodes, they manifest great ingenuity and mechanical skill.
The figures on the preceding page exemplify various forms
of insects in this stage of their existence.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><i>a</i>, Pupa of a Water-Beetle (<i>Hydrophilus</i>); <i>b</i>, pupa of <i>Sphinx Ligustri</i>.</div>
</div>

<p>When larvæ are full grown, they cast their skins for the
last time, undergo a complete change of form, excepting in
the case of ametabolous larvæ, cease to eat, and remain nearly
motionless. The inner skin of the larva now becomes converted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
into a membranous or leathery covering, which wraps
the insect closely up like a mummy: in this condition it is
termed <i>Pupa</i>, from its resemblance to an infant in swaddling
bands. Nympha, or nymph, is another term given to insects
in this stage;<a name="FNanchor_M" id="FNanchor_M"></a><a href="#Footnote_M" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> moreover from the pupæ of many of the
butterflies appearing gilt as if with gold, the Greeks called
them <i>Chrysalides</i>, and the Romans <i>Aureliæ</i>, and hence
naturalists frequently call a pupa <i>chrysalis</i>, even when it is
not gilt. We shall see, as we proceed, the curious contrivances
resorted to for protecting insects in this helpless
state. The following are examples of insects in the <i>imago</i>,
or perfect state.</p>

</div>

<p>After a certain time, the insect which has remained in its
pupa-case, like a mass of jelly without shape, is gradually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
preparing for its final change, when it takes the form of a
perfect insect. This state was called by Linnæus <i>Imago</i>,
because the insect, having thrown off its mask, becomes a
perfect <i>image</i> of its species. Of some, this last portion of
their existence is very short, others live through a year, and
some exist for longer periods. They feed lightly, and never
increase in size. The chief object of all is to perpetuate
their species, after which the greater number quickly die.
It is in this state that they exercise those remarkable instincts
for the preservation of their race, which are exhibited in their
preparations for the shelter of their eggs, and the nourishment
of their larvæ.</p>

<p class="caption2">STRUCTURES FOR PROTECTING EGGS.&mdash;MASON-WASPS; MASON-BEES;
MINING-BEES.</p>


<p>The provisions which are made by the different species of
insects for protecting their eggs, appear in many cases
to be admirably proportioned to the kind of danger and
destruction to which they may be exposed. The eggs themselves,
indeed, are not so liable to depredation and injury as
the young brood hatched from them; for, like the seeds of
plants, they are capable of withstanding greater degrees both
of heat and cold than the insects which produce them.
According to the experiments of Spallanzani, the eggs of
frogs that had been exposed to various degrees of artificial
heat were scarcely altered in their productive powers by a
temperature of 111&deg; of Fahrenheit, but they became corrupted
after 133&deg;. He tried the same experiment upon tadpoles and
frogs, and found they all died at 111&deg;. Silkworms died at a
temperature of 108&deg;, while their eggs did not entirely cease
to be fertile till 144&deg;. The larvæ of flesh-flies perished,
while the eggs of the same species continued fertile, at about
the same comparative degrees of heat as in the preceding
instances. Intense cold has a still less effect upon eggs than
extreme heat. Spallanzani exposed the eggs of silk-worms to
an artificial cold 23&deg; below zero, and yet, in the subsequent
spring, they all produced caterpillars. Insects almost invariably
die at the temperature of 14&deg;, that is, at 18&deg; below
the freezing point.<a name="FNanchor_N" id="FNanchor_N"></a><a href="#Footnote_N" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> The care of insects for the protection
of their eggs is not entirely directed to their preservation in
the most favourable temperature for being hatched, but to
secure them against the numerous enemies which would
attempt their destruction; and, above all, to protect the grubs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
when they are first developed, from those injuries to which they
are peculiarly exposed. Their prospective contrivances for
accomplishing these objects are in the highest degree curious.</p>

<p>Most persons have more or less acquaintance with the
hives of the social species of bees and wasps; but little is
generally known of the nests constructed by the solitary
species, though in many respects these are not inferior to the
others in displays of ingenuity and skill. We admire the
social bees, labouring together for one common end, in the
same way that we look with delight upon the great division
of labour in a well-ordered manufactory. As in a cotton-mill
some attend to the carding of the raw material, some to its
formation into single threads, some to the gathering these
threads upon spindles, others to the union of many threads
into one,&mdash;all labouring with invariable precision because
they attend to a single object;&mdash;so do we view with delight
and wonder the successive steps by which the hive-bees bring
their beautiful work to its completion,&mdash;striving, by individual
efforts, to accomplish their general task, never impeding
each other by useless assistance, each taking a particular
department, and each knowing its own duties. We may,
however, not the less admire the solitary wasp or bee, who
begins and finishes every part of its destined work; just as
we admire the ingenious mechanic who perfects something
useful or ornamental entirely by the labour of his own
hands,&mdash;whether he be the patient Chinese carver, who cuts
the most elaborately-decorated boxes out of a solid piece of
ivory, or the turner of Europe, who produces every variety of
elegant form by the skilful application of the simplest means.</p>

<p>Our island abounds with many varieties of solitary wasps
and bees; and their nests may therefore be easily discovered
by those who, in the proper seasons, are desirous of observing
the peculiarities of their architecture.</p>

<p class="caption3 smcap">Mason-Wasps.</p>

<p>In September, 1828, a common species of solitary mason-wasp
(<i>Odynerus</i>, <span class="smcap">Latr.</span>) was observed by us (J. R.) on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
east wall of a house at Lee, in Kent, very busy in excavating
a hole in one of the bricks, about five feet from the ground.
Whether there might not have been an accidental hole in the
brick before the wasp commenced her labours, is unknown,
as she had made considerable progress in the work when
first observed: but the brick was one of the hardest of the
yellow sort made in this neighbourhood. The most remarkable
circumstance in the process of hewing into the brick
was the care of the insect in removing to a distance the
fragments which from time to time she succeeded in detaching.
It did not appear to suit her design to wear down the
brick, particle by particle, as the furniture beetle (<i>Anobium
pertinax</i>) does in making its pin-hole galleries in old wood.
Our wasp-architect, on the contrary, by means of her strong
<i>tranchant</i>-toothed jaws, severed a piece usually about the
bigness of a mustard-seed. It might have been supposed
that these fragments would have been tossed out of the hole
as the work proceeded, without further concern; as the mole
tosses above ground the earth which has been cleared
out of its subterranean gallery. The wasp was of a different
opinion; for it was possible that a heap of brick chips, at the
bottom of the wall, might lead to the discovery of her nest
by some of her enemies, particularly by one or other of the
numerous tribe of what are called <i>ichneumon</i>-flies. This
name is given to them, from the similarity of their habit of
destroying eggs, to that of the little animal which proves so
formidable an enemy to the multiplication of the crocodile of
Egypt. They may be also denominated <i>cuckoo</i>-flies, because,
like that bird, they thrust their egg into the nest of another
species. These flies are continually prowling about and
prying into every corner, to find, by stealth, a nidus for their
eggs. It might have been some such consideration as this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
which induced the wasp to carry off the fragments as they
were successively detached. That concealment was the
motive, indeed, was proved: for one of the fragments which
fell out of the hole by accident, she immediately sought for
at the bottom of the wall, and carried off like the rest. It
was no easy matter to get out one of the fragments, as may
readily be conceived when the size of the insect is compared
with that of the entrance of which this (
<img src="images/024b.png" width="21" height="14" alt="Entrance" />) is the exact size,
as taken from the impression of a bit of dough upon the hole
when finished. It was only by seizing the fragment with her
jaws, and retreating backwards, that the matter could be
accomplished; though, after the interior of the excavation
was barely large enough to admit of her turning round, she
more than once attempted to make her exit head-foremost,
but always unsuccessfully. The weight of the fragments
removed did not appear to impede her flight, and she
generally returned to her task in about two or three minutes.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Mandibles&mdash;Jaws of Mason-Wasp.&mdash;Greatly magnified.</div>
</div>

<p>Within two days the excavation was completed; but it
required two other days to line it with a coating of clay, to
deposit the eggs, two in number, and, no doubt, to imprison
a few live spiders or caterpillars for the young when hatched&mdash;a
process which was first observed by Ray and Willughby,<a name="FNanchor_O" id="FNanchor_O"></a><a href="#Footnote_O" class="fnanchor">[O]</a>
but which has since been frequently ascertained. In the
present instance, this peculiarity was not seen; but the little
architect was detected in closing up the entrance, which was
formed of a layer of clay more than double the thickness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the interior lining. In November following, we hewed away
the brick around this nest, and found the whole excavation
was rather less than an inch in depth.</p>

</div>

<p>Notwithstanding all the precautions of the careful parent
to conceal her nest it was found out by one of the cuckoo-flies
(<i>Tachina larvarum?</i>)&mdash;probably a common species very
similar to the house-fly, but rather larger, which deposited
an egg there; and the grub hatched from it, after devouring
one of the wasp-grubs, formed itself a cocoon (<i>a</i>), as did the
other undevoured grub of the wasp (<i>b</i>). Both awaited the
return of summer to change into winged insects, burst their
cerements, and proceed as their parents did.</p>

</div>

<p>Another mason-wasp (<i>Odynerus murarius</i>, <span class="smcap">Latr.</span>), differing
little in appearance from the former, may often be seen
frequenting sandy banks exposed to the sun, and constructing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
its singular burrows. The sort of sand-bank which it
selects is hard and compact; and though this may be more
difficult to penetrate, the walls are not liable to fall down
upon the little miner. In such a bank, the mason-wasp
bores a tubular gallery two or three inches deep. The sand
upon which Réaumur found some of these wasps at work was
almost as hard as stone, and yielded with difficulty to his
nail; but the wasps dug into it with ease, having recourse, as
he ascertained, to the ingenious device of moistening it by
letting fall two or three drops of fluid from their mouth,
which rendered the mass ductile, and the separation of the
grains easy to the double pickaxe of the little pioneers.</p>

<i>a</i>, The tower of the nest; <i>b</i>, the entrance after the tower is removed; <i>c</i>, the cell; <i>d</i>, the
cell, with a roll of caterpillars prepared for the larva.</div>
</div>

<p>When this wasp has detached a few grains of the moistened
sand, it kneads them together into a pellet about the size of
one of the seeds of a gooseberry. With the first pellet which
it detaches, it lays the foundation of a round tower, as an
outwork, immediately over the mouth of its nest. Every
pellet which it afterwards carries off from the interior is
added to the wall of this outer round tower, which advances
in height as the hole in the sand increases in depth. Every
two or three minutes, however, during these operations, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
takes a short excursion, for the purpose, probably, of replenishing
its store of fluid wherewith to moisten the sand.
Yet so little time is lost, that Réaumur has seen a mason-wasp
dig in an hour a hole the length of its body, and at the
same time build as much of its round tower. For the greater
part of its height this round tower is perpendicular; but
towards the summit it bends into a curve, corresponding to
the bend of the insect&rsquo;s body, which in all cases of insect
architecture, is the model followed. The pellets which form
the walls of the tower are not very nicely joined, and numerous
vacuities are left between them, giving it the appearance
of filigree-work. That it should be thus slightly built is
not surprising, for it is intended as a temporary structure for
protecting the insect while it is excavating its hole, and as a
pile of materials, well arranged and ready at hand, for the
completion of the interior building,&mdash;in the same way that
workmen make a regular pile of bricks near the spot where
they are going to build. This seems, in fact, to be the main
design of the tower, which is taken down as expeditiously as
it had been reared. Réaumur thinks that, by piling in the
sand which has previously been dug out, the wasp intends to
guard her progeny for a time from being exposed to the too
violent heat of the sun; and he has even sometimes seen that
there were not sufficient materials in the tower, in which case
the wasp had recourse to the rubbish she had thrown out
after the tower was completed. By raising a tower of the
materials which she excavates, the wasp produces the same
shelter from external heat as a human creature would who
chose to inhabit a deep cellar of a high house. She further
protects her progeny from the ichneumon-fly, as the
engineer constructs an outwork to render more difficult the
approach of an enemy to the citadel. Réaumur has seen
this indefatigable enemy of the wasp peep into the mouth of
the tower, and then retreat, apparently frightened at the
depth of the cell which he was anxious to invade.</p>

<p>The mason-wasp does not furnish the cell she has thus
constructed with pollen and honey, like the solitary bees,
but with living caterpillars, and these always of the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
species&mdash;being of a green colour, and without feet. She
fixes the caterpillars together in a spiral column: they cannot
alter their position, although they remain alive. They are
an easy prey to their smaller enemy; and when the grub has
eaten them all up, it spins a case, and is transformed into a
pupa, which afterwards becomes a wasp. The number of
caterpillars which is thus found in the lower cavity of the
mason-wasp&rsquo;s nest is ordinarily from ten to twelve. The
mother is careful to lay in the exact quantity of provision
which is necessary to the growth of the grub before he quits
his retreat. He works through his store till his increase in
this state is perfected, and he is on the point of undergoing
a change into another state, in which he requires no food.
The careful purveyor, cruel indeed in her choice of a supply,
but not the less directed by an unerring instinct, selects
such caterpillars as she is conscious have completed their
growth, and will remain thus imprisoned without increase or
corruption till their destroyer has gradually satisfied the
necessities of his being. &ldquo;All that the worm of the wasp,&rdquo;
says Réaumur, &ldquo;has to do in his nest, from his birth to his
transformation, is to eat.&rdquo; There is another species of wasp
which does not at once enclose in its nest all the sustenance
which its larva will require before transformation, but which
from time to time imprisons a living caterpillar, and when
that is consumed, opens the nest and introduces another.</p>

<p>[The upper figure in the accompanying illustration exhibits
two of the curious towers built by this interesting
insect and drawn of their natural size.]</p>

<p>The insect is one of the most plentiful in England, and
can be found on sunny days, flitting about sand-banks and
making its curious habitations. The length is nearly half an
inch, and the colour is black, variegated with five yellow
bands upon the abdomen.</p>

<p>The lower figure represents the habitations of one of the
British solitary wasps, <i>Pompilus punctum</i>, and is given in
order to show a curious resemblance in the structure. The
specimen from which the sketch was taken was found under
the eaves of a roof which protected a bee-hive. The cells
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
were thirteen in number, very carefully constructed of earth,
and several of them were closed. Although these cells were
not fossorial in their nature, several other species of the same
genus are as accomplished burrowers as any insect. <i>Pompilus
plumbeus</i>, for example, another black species, burrows into
sand, and is very plentiful on our more southern shores. It
may usually be found hovering about sand-banks, and flitting
about with such agility that it is by no means an easy insect
to catch. The male is peculiarly apt to evade the stroke of
the entomologist&rsquo;s net.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 327px;">
<img src="images/029.png" width="327" height="354" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Then there is <i>Pompilus rufipes</i>, which is a black insect,
but distinguished by the conspicuous red colour of the hind
legs. This is very fond of our coasts, and may be found
wherever the soil is suitable for its excavations. Many
species of this genus carry off spiders for the purpose of
provisioning their nests. Several species, which live far
inland, prefer light and dry earth to sand, and make therein
their burrows, preferring our little white spider as the provision
for their young. Although the same insect may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
often observed to carry the same kind of prey to its home, it
does not at all follow that no change is ever made.</p>

<p>But the most remarkable example of this fact may be
found in a very common swift-winged insect, black in colour,
with a reddish patch on the end of the abdomen. Its name
is <i>Trachytes pompiliformis</i>, and it generally stocks its nest
with small caterpillars. Mr. F. Smith, however, has taken
it when in the act of carrying off a small species of grasshopper&mdash;certainly
the very last insect that would be thought
of as likely to be immured by a captor which must be
scarcely larger than itself.</p>

<p>This insect is to be found in most warm and sandy situations,
and may be looked for at the end of summer and
beginning of autumn. It may be easily known by its red
spot on the abdomen, and the large, transverse head; it is
wider than the thorax.</p>

<p>One species of mining-bee, not often found in England,
chooses some very singular insects wherewith to feed its
young. Its name is <i>Philanthus triangulum</i>, and it is a very
fierce, waspish-looking creature, with a large wide head,
wider even than the thorax, sharp and powerful jaws, and
with broad wings. The head and thighs are black, with a
few spots of a yellowish white, and the abdomen is yellow,
with a black spot in the middle of each segment. Its length
rather exceeds half an inch. The actions of this insect do not
belie its looks, for it is a fierce and active creature, seizing
upon various bees and dragging them into its tunnel.</p>

<p>Mr. F. Smith discovered the metropolis of this usually
scarce insect at Sandown Bay, in the Isle of Wight, and has
given an interesting description of its habits. He states that
although it is so ferocious towards other insects, it appears to be
perfectly harmless as far as man is concerned, allowing itself
to be handled without even attempting to use its sting.
Indeed, he was quite unable to provoke the insect to do so.
Various bees were captured by the Philanthus, and the favourites
seemed to belong to the genus Andrena, itself a burrowing
bee, and the common hive-bee. The Philanthus seemed
perfectly indifferent whether they attacked the comparatively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
small and feeble Andrena, or the formidable hive-bee, taking
them as they came, and caring nothing for the sting. The
Philanthus that burrowed on the top of the cliff, seemed to
prefer the hive-bee, because the red clover attracted greater
numbers of that insect. Those that made their burrows at
the top of the cliff, took the Andrenæ. Of course, the Philanthus
is obliged to catch more of the Andrenæ than the hive
bees. Only one species of this genus is known in England;
it is to be found in July and August.</p>

<p>There is a very large genus of rather small humming-bees,
many of which are popularly mistaken for wasps, on account
of their sharply pointed and yellow banded abdomen; they
belong to the genus Crabro, and are extremely variable in the
material into which they burrow, and the insects with which
they feed their young. Some species burrow into dry
bramble sticks. If the reader should wish to obtain specimens
of them, as well as other burrowers, he will find
bramble, rose, and jessamine sticks most prolific in them.
The best plan is to collect a quantity of these sticks and put
them into glass tubes, with the ends stopped with wire gauze;
there is then an absolute certainty of identifying the insect
with its habitation. The spring is the best time for collecting.
Sometimes these creatures are afflicted with parasites,
which also are detained in the tube, so as to yield valuable
information to the captor.</p>

<p>Some species burrow in sand-banks and feed their young
with gnats, others burrow into dead timber, and stock their
tunnels with flies of various kinds. One very useful species,
<i>Crabro lævis</i>, burrows in sand-banks, and provisions its nest
with the noxious turnip-fleas (<i>Halticæ</i>), great numbers of
which are needed to stock a single burrow. It is rather a
social insect, many burrows being often found near each other.
The turnip-flea has so hard a shell, that the young Crabro
seems hardly capable of eating it. Mr. Smith, however, has
remarked that another burrowing-bee stocks its nest with
certain weevils that are almost too hard to be pierced with a
pin, and that the shell is probably softened by the damp
ground. The greater number of this group, however, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
burrowers into the ground, and stock their nests with flies of
some kind.</p>

<p>Another species of this large genus, <i>Crabro luteipalpis</i>, is
fond of making its burrows in the mortar of old walls, preferring
those spots where nails have been drawn, making the
process of burrowing easier for the insect. It is not uncommon
in the outskirts of London. All gardeners, especially
those who cultivate roses, ought to encourage this
very little insect, and welcome its presence, for it provisions
its nest with the aphides, or green blight, which
infect the rose-trees, and which have destroyed so many
promising plants.</p>

<p>The female, which is the larger of the two sexes, measures
only three lines in length. The colour is shining black, and
the head is rather squared.</p>

<p>Among other burrowing species of this genus we may
mention <i>Crabro varius</i>, a rather long and slender insect, black
in colour, with yellow spottings about the thorax. It prefers
very hard fine sand, such as is found in partially excavated
sand-banks, and provisions its burrows with gnats. It is
tolerably plentiful.</p>

<p>Our last example of the earth-burrowers belonging to this
genus is <i>Crabro Wesmoeli</i>, which chooses similar localities,
being mostly found in sand-banks. It carries off flies of
different kinds for the food of its young. There is a very
common insect, closely allied to the last mentioned genus, whose
horns are worthy of notice. This is called <i>Typoxylon figulus</i>.
It is a small creature, with a large head and slender abdomen.
Its colour is black, and on the edges of the segments of the
abdomen there is a little silvery shining down.</p>

<p>It generally burrows into light earth, though it sometimes
drives its tunnel into decayed wood. In either case, it provisions
its nest with spiders, flying into the hedges, pulling the
unfortunate spiders out of their webs, and carrying them into
the burrow. One burrow contains a series of cells, which
are separated from each other by partitions of sand, the
particles of which are firmly cemented together by some
glutinous substance secreted by the insect. Some species of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
this genus burrow into the pith of the bramble and other
shrubs.</p>

<p>One of the most determined of our British burrowers is
the insect which is known by the name of <i>Ammophila sabulosa</i>.
It has a large, squared head, wider than the thorax, a very
long and slender body, and short though powerful wings.
The colour is black, with a slight rust-red tint on the base
of the abdomen.</p>

<p>When the female has dug her burrow, she sets off in search
of a caterpillar of proportionate size, and having conveyed it
into her dwelling, she affixes an egg to the imprisoned larva,
and goes off in search of another, carefully stopping up the
entrance with stones. In fine weather she will fill one
burrow with caterpillars in a few hours, and then begin
another nursery for the future young. This species appears
always to make use of caterpillars, but another allied
species prefers spiders. Mr. F. Smith mentions that he has
found in a high sand-bank as many as twenty females
apparently hibernating together till suitable weather enabled
them to pursue their usual economy.</p>

<p>There really seems to be scarcely any genus of insect that is
not seized upon by one or other of these burrowers, and packed
away in a half living state to form food for their young.
There is one of these solitary burrowing wasps called the <i>Astata
boops</i>, deriving its specific name from its large round eyes,
which in the male completely unite at the back of the head.
The abdomen is shaped something like a boy&rsquo;s peg-top, or a
symmetrical turnip, the peg of the top, or the point of the
turnip, corresponding to the top of the abdomen. Its length
is about half an inch, and its colour is black, with a rust-red
patch on the end of the abdomen.</p>

<p>There is a remarkably pretty, and very variable, sand-wasp,
which is plentiful in most parts of the country. The colour
is black, and the abdomen is banded by four yellow bars.
Its feet are also yellow. Mr. Smith has written a very
interesting account of the proceedings of this insect.</p>

<p>"Having frequently observed the habits of the type of this
genus, <i>Mellinus arvensis</i>, and reared it from the larva state,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
a few observations are here recorded. When the parent
insect has formed a burrow of the required length, and
enlarged the extremity into a chamber of proper dimensions,
she issues forth in search of the proper nutriment for her
young; this consists of various dipterous insects: species of
various genera are equally adapted to her purpose&mdash;<i>Muscidæ</i>,
<i>Syrphidæ</i>, &amp;c., are captured.</p>

<p>"It is amusing to see four or five females lie in wait upon
a patch of cow-dung until some luckless fly settles on it.
When this happens, a cunning and gradual approach is made;
a sudden attempt would not succeed. The fly is the insect
of quickest flight, therefore a degree of intrigue is necessary.
This is managed by running past the victim slowly, and
apparently in an unconcerned manner, until the poor fly is
caught unawares, and carried off by the Mellinus to its burrow.
The first fly being deposited, an egg is laid. The
necessary number of flies are soon secured, and her task is
completed. Sometimes she is interrupted by rainy weather,
and it is some days ere she can store up the quantity required.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A larva found feeding became full-fed in ten days. Six
flies were devoured, the heads, harder parts of the throat,
portions of the abdomen, and the legs, being left untouched.
The larva spins a tough, thin, brown silken cocoon, passes
the winter and spring in the larva state, changes to the
nymph on the approach of summer, and appears about the
beginning of autumn in the perfect state.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is a genus of hymenopterous insects known by the
name of <i>Scolia</i>, which are remarkable for their fossorial
powers. The species represented in the engraving is called
<i>Scolia Xantiana</i>, and is a native of California.</p>

<p>When the female Scolia is about to fulfil the great object
for which she came into the world, she looks about for a
suitable spot, where the ground is not too hard, and digs a
perpendicular burrow of some depth, enlarging it at the bottom,
and digging horizontally, so that the general shape of
the burrow somewhat resembles that of a boot. When the
burrow is completed, the insect flies off in search of food for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
its young, and presently returns, bearing with her a grub,
which she clasps tightly under her chest, so that her wings
may be at liberty. She then takes the grub to the bottom of
the tunnel, deposits an egg upon it, and if the grub be a
small one, goes off to fetch another. When a sufficiency of
food has been obtained, she covers up the grub and egg and
leaves the latter to its fate. In due time it is hatched, and
begins straightway to feed upon its unfortunate fellow-prisoner.
When all the food is gone, it is old enough to
assume the perfect form, and when it finally becomes a perfect
insect, it makes its way into the open air, and straightway
looks out for a mate.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 455px;">
<img src="images/035.png" width="455" height="392" alt="" />
</div>

<p>An European species of this genus, which is called <i>Scolia
flavifrons</i>, is remarkable for the four large, round spots on
the upper surface of the abdomen. This species always feeds
its young on the grub of a beetle, one of the lamellicorn
group, and in this case the grub is so large that one is sufficient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>In the illustration, the left hand figure shows a section of
the burrow of <i>Scolia Xantiana</i>, and exhibits the enlarged portion
of the tunnel in which are placed the young Scolia and
the unfortunate grub which has to serve it for food. The
insect itself is seen in the centre.</p>

<p>For figures 3 and 4 the reader is referred to the heading
&ldquo;Spiders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is another British insect which feeds its young with
flies, and which catches them in a manner somewhat similar
to that which has recently been narrated when treating of
the Mellinus. The insect in question is called <i>Oxybelus
unuglumis</i>, and is a very pretty species. Its length is seldom
much more than a quarter of an inch, and its colour is
black, with some silvery hair about the face, and with some
spots and bands of white, more or less yellowish, upon the
pointed abdomen. The male is usually smaller than the
female, but compensates for this want of size by his more
brilliant colouring.</p>

<p>Mr. F. Smith has described to me the method employed by
this insect in catching flies. In the air it would not have a
chance of success, and so it proceeds after a fashion very
much like that which is adopted by the hunting-spider.
Choosing some spot where flies are likely to settle, such as a
bare, sunny bank, the Oxybelus alights upon it and begins to
run about without any apparent motive. At first the flies
are rather alarmed, but after a while they become accustomed
to the rapid movements of their foe, and allow it to come
nearer and nearer the cause of its perambulations. As soon
as it has succeeded in drawing within a few inches of a fly,
the Oxybelus leaps upon it, just like the hunting spider on
its prey, and flies off before the victim knows that an attack
is even meditated.</p>

<p>The burrow of this species is made in hard white sand.</p>

<p>Several species of the genus <i>Cerceris</i> are noted, not only as
burrowers, but for the exceeding variety of the food which
they store in their dwellings. The most common species,
<i>Cerceris arenaria</i>, makes its tunnel in hard, sandy spots, and
is usually to be found about the middle of July and August.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
The length of this insect rather exceeds half an inch, and its
colour is black, profusely spotted and barred with yellow. It
is rather slenderly made, and gives little external indications
of the great strength which it possesses.</p>

<p>This insect prefers to stock its nest with weevils of different
kinds&mdash;a most singular choice, when the hardness of the
exterior is taken into consideration. The well-known nut-weevil
(<i>Balaninus nucum</i>), with its hard, round body, and
long mouth, is frequently taken by this species of Cerceris,
and Mr. Smith further mentions that he has captured it in
the act of taking the weevil called <i>Otiorhynchus sulcatus</i> to its
nest.</p>

<p>This beetle is among the most noxious of our garden foes,
and the more so because its ravages are unseen. In its larval
state it infests the roots of many of our succulent plants and
flowers, and has a habit of eating away the plant just at the
junction of the root and stem. Even flowers in pots are apt
to be infested by this insect, and often die without the cause
of their death being discovered. It is about half an inch in
length, white, and is destitute of feet, their office being performed
by bundles of stiff hairs, which are dispersed round
the body.</p>

<p>In its perfect state it is about the third of an inch in
length, the colour is black, covered with a coating of very fine
and short grey hairs, and along its back are a number of
short longitudinal grooves. From this latter circumstance it
derives its name of &ldquo;<i>sulcatus</i>,&rdquo; or grooved.</p>

<p>The exterior of this beetle is extremely hard, even exceptionally
so among the hard-bodied weevils. It is extremely
difficult to get a pin through the body, and the entomologist
is often obliged to bore a hole with a stout needle
before the pin can be inserted. Yet, the Cerceris uses this
insect as the food of its young, and stores them away in its
burrow. That the young should eat them seems as impossible
as if a lobster or a box-tortoise had been inserted in their
place. It is, however, thought by most practical entomologists
that the shell of the weevil is softened by lying in the
damp ground, and that as the young is not hatched for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
several days after the burrow is sealed up, the hard wing
cases have time to soften.</p>

<p>Another species of the same genus, <i>Cerceris interrupta</i>, has
the curious habit of making its burrow in the hardest ground
which it can penetrate, and is generally to be found in well
used footpaths. This species also uses weevils for the food
of its young, but prefers those small weevils which are classed
under the genus <i>Apion</i>, and which are readily known by their
pear-shaped bodies and rather elongated heads. [There are
about seventy species of <i>Apion</i>, so that the Cerceris has plenty
of choice.]</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Mason-Bees.</p>

<p>It would not be easy to find a more simple, and, at the
same time, ingenious specimen of insect architecture than the
nests of those species of solitary bees which have been justly
called mason-bees (<i>Megachile</i>, <span class="smcap">Latreille</span>). Réaumur, who
was struck by the analogies between the proceedings of
insects and human arts, first gave to bees, wasps, and caterpillars
those names which indicate the character of their
labours; and which, though they may be considered a little
fanciful, are at least calculated to arrest the attention. The
nests of mason-bees are constructed of various materials;
some with sand, some with earth mixed with chalk, and some
with a mixture of earthy substances and wood.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Mason-Bee (<i>Anthophora retusa</i>).&mdash;Natural size.</div>
</div>

<p>On the north-east wall of Greenwich Park, facing the road,
and about four feet from the ground, we discovered (J. R.),
December 10th, 1828, the nest of a mason-bee, formed in the
perpendicular line of cement between two bricks. Externally
there was an irregular cake of dry mud, precisely as if a
handful of wet road-stuff had been taken from a cart-rut and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
thrown against the wall; though, upon closer inspection,
the cake contained more small stones than usually occur in
the mud of the adjacent cart-ruts. We should in fact have
passed it by without notice had there not been a circular hole
on one side of it, indicating the perforation of some insect.
This hole was found to be the orifice of a cell about an inch
deep, exactly of the form and size of a lady&rsquo;s thimble, finely
polished, and of the colour of plaster-of-paris, but stained in
various places with yellow.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Exterior Wall of Mason-Bee&rsquo;s Nest.</div>
</div>

<p>This cell was empty; but, upon removing the cake of mud,
we discovered another cell, separated from the former by a
partition about a quarter of an inch thick, and in it a living
bee, from which the preceding figure was drawn, and which,
as we supposed, had just changed from the pupa to the
winged state, in consequence of the uncommon mildness of
the weather. The one which had occupied the adjacent cell
had no doubt already dug its way out of its prison, and
would probably fall a victim to the first frost.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Our nest contained only two cells&mdash;perhaps from there not
being room between the bricks for more.</p>

<p>[There are only four British species of this genus. One
species, <i>A. acervorum</i>, seems perfectly indifferent whether it
burrows into banks or into the mortar of old walls. If
possible, the former locality seems to be the most favoured.</p>

<p>This species is notable for the many parasites who infect
the habitation and destroy the inmates. Perhaps the very
worst and most destructive of these parasites is the common
earwig, which wreaks wholesale desolation in the nest. It
creeps into the burrow, and if it finds a store of pollen laid up
for the young, it will eat the pollen. But if the young grub be
hatched it will eat the grub. If the inmate be in the pupal
state, or even if it be ready to emerge in its perfect condition,
the earwig will eat it.</p>

<p>There are two bees which are parasitic upon this unfortunate
insect, both belonging the genus <i>Melecta</i>.</p>

<p>But the most destructive of these parasites appears to be an
insect which belongs to the great family of <i>Chalcididæ</i>. These
insects are of the hymenopterous order, are of very minute
dimensions, and of the most brilliant colours. Indeed, if
they were an inch or two in length, instead of the eighth or
twelfth of an inch, they would not suffer in comparison with
the most gorgeous inhabitants of tropical countries.</p>

<p>Their forms are most eccentric, some species having the
abdomen small and round and set on a long footstalk, while
others have that portion of the body placed so closely against
the thorax, that the short footstalk is scarcely visible. Others
have certain joints of the legs so large that a single joint
equals the entire abdomen. Some have the ovipositor projecting
boldly from the body, while others have it tucked up
underneath, and others again have it quite short. But there
is one point which distinguishes them all, namely, the almost
veinless character of the wings.</p>

<p>Some of the <i>Chalcididæ</i> are parasitic upon insects in their
earliest stages, actually depositing their eggs in those of
moths and butterflies. Others are entirely parasitic upon
parasites, laying their eggs in the aphidii, which are parasites
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of the aphis. Some of them haunt the galls, and contrive to
make their young parasitic upon the immature cynipidæ
which lie within the gall. The common small tortoise-shell
butterfly is terribly infested with these little creatures, and
we have bred hundreds of the gem-like <i>Chalcididæ</i> from the
larvæ and pupæ of that butterfly.</p>

<p>One of the <i>Chalcididæ</i>, belonging to the genus <i>Melittobia</i>, is
a parasite upon the <i>Anthophora</i>; and the curious part of the
proceeding is, that it finds there another parasite, which
becomes developed in the home of the bee: the <i>Melittobia</i>
feeds indiscriminately upon the bee and parasite.</p>

<p>Although the <i>Melittobia</i> does not make such wholesale
destruction as is wrought by the earwig when it gets into a
nest, it does more damage to the bee, on account of its great
numbers. Some three or four females will lay a great
quantity of eggs within a nest, and from those eggs a hundred
of the young will be developed. When the larvæ are fully
grown, they quit their hold of their prey, and fall to the
bottom of the cell, where they lie until they have assumed
the perfect form. They then burst forth, together with those
of the bee that may have escaped their attacks.]</p>

<p>An interesting account is given by Réaumur of another
mason-bee (<i>Megachile muraria</i>), not a native of Britain, selecting
earthy sand, grain by grain; her glueing a mass of these
together with saliva, and building with them her cells from the
foundation. But the cells of the Greenwich Park nest were
apparently composed of the mortar of the brick wall; though
the external covering seems to have been constructed as
Réaumur describes his nest, with the occasional addition of
small stones.</p>

<p>About the middle of May, 1829, we discovered the mine
from which all the various species of mason-bees in the
vicinity seemed to derive materials for their nests. (J. R.)
It was a bank of brown clay, facing the east, and close by the
margin of the river Ravensbourn, at Lee, in Kent. The
frequent resort of the bees to this spot attracted the attention
of some workmen, who, deceived by their resemblance to
wasps, pointed it out as a wasps&rsquo; nest; though they were not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
a little surprised to see so numerous a colony at this early
season. As the bees had dug a hole in the bank, where
they were incessantly entering and reappearing, we were of
opinion that they were a peculiar sort of the social earth-bees
(<i>Bombi</i>). On approaching the spot, however, we remarked
that the bees were not alarmed, and manifested none of the
irritation usual in such cases, the consequence of jealous
affection for their young. This led us to observe their
operations more minutely; and we soon discovered that on
issuing from the hole each bee carried out in its mandibles a
piece of clay. Still supposing that they were social earth-bees,
we concluded that they were busy excavating a hollow
for their nest, and carrying off the refuse to prevent discovery.
The mouth of the hole was overhung, and partly concealed,
by a large pebble. This we removed, and widened the
entrance of the hole, intending to dig down and ascertain
the state of the operations; but we soon found that it was of
small depth. The bees, being scared away, began scooping
out clay from another hole about a yard distant from the first.
Upon our withdrawing a few feet from the first hole, they
returned thither in preference, and continued assiduously
digging and removing the clay. It became obvious, therefore,
from their thus changing place, that they were not constructing
a nest, but merely quarrying for clay as a building
material. By catching one of the bees (<i>Osmia bicornis</i>)
when it was loaded with its burden, we ascertained that the
clay was not only carefully kneaded, but was also more moist
than the mass from which it had been taken. The bee,
therefore, in preparing the pellet, which was nearly as large
as a garden-pea, had moistened it with its saliva, or some
similar fluid, to render it, we may suppose, more tenacious,
and better fitted for building. The reason of their digging a
hole, instead of taking clay indiscriminately from the bank,
appeared to be for the purpose of economizing their saliva,
as the weather was dry, and the clay at the surface was
parched and hard. It must have been this circumstance
which induced them to prefer digging a hole, as it were, in
concert, though each of them had to build a separate nest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>The distance to which they carried the clay was probably
considerable, as there was no wall near, in the direction they
all flew towards, upon which they could build; and in the
same direction also, it is worthy of remark, they could have
procured much nearer the very same sort of clay. Whatever
might be the cause of their preference, we could not but
admire their extraordinary industry. It did not require more
than half a minute to knead one of the pellets of clay; and, from
their frequent returns, probably not more than five minutes
to carry it to the nest, and apply it where wanted. From
the dryness of the weather, indeed, it was indispensable for
them to work rapidly, otherwise the clay could not have been
made to hold together. The extent of the whole labour of
forming a single nest may be imagined, if we estimate that it
must take several hundred pellets of clay for its completion.
If a bee work fourteen or fifteen hours a-day, therefore,
carrying ten or twelve pellets to its nest every hour, it will
be able to finish the structure in about two or three days;
allowing some hours of extra time for the more nice workmanship
of the cells in which the eggs are to be deposited, and
the young grubs reared.</p>

<p>That the construction of such a nest is not a merely
agreeable exercise to the mason-bee has been sufficiently
proved by M. Du Hamel. He has observed a bee (<i>Megachile
muraria</i>) less careful to perform the necessary labour for the
protection of her offspring than those we have described,
but not less desirous of obtaining this protection, attempt
to usurp the nest which another had formed. A fierce
battle was invariably the consequence of this attempt; for
the true mistress would never give place to the intruder.
The motive for the injustice and the resistance was an indisposition
to further labour. The trial of strength was
probably, sometimes, of as little use in establishing the
right as it is amongst mankind; and the proper owner,
exhausted by her efforts, had doubtless often to surrender to
the dishonest usurper.</p>

<p>The account which Réaumur has given of the operations
of this class of bees differs considerably from that which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
we have here detailed; from the species being different, or
from his bees not having been able to procure moist clay.
On the contrary, sand was the chief material used by the
mason-bees (<i>Megachile muraria</i>); which they had the patience
to select from the walks of a garden, and knead into a
paste or mortar, adapted to their building. They had
consequently to expend a much greater quantity of saliva
than our bees (<i>Osmia bicornis</i>), which worked with moist
clay. Réaumur, indeed, ascertained that every individual
grain of sand is moistened previous to its being joined to
the pellet, in order to make it adhere more effectually.
The tenacity of the mass is, besides, rendered stronger, he
tells us, by adding a proportion of earth or garden-mould.
In this manner, a ball of mortar is formed, about the size of
a small shot, and carried off to the nest. When the structure
of this is examined, it has all the appearance externally
of being composed of earth and small stones or gravel.
The ancients, who were by no means accurate naturalists,
having observed bees carrying pellets of earth and small
stones, supposed that they employed these to add to their
weight, in order to steady their flight when impeded by
the wind.</p>

<p>The nests thus constructed appear to have been more
durable edifices than those which have fallen under our observation;&mdash;for
Réaumur says they were harder than many
sorts of stone, and could scarcely be penetrated with a
knife. Ours, on the contrary, do not seem harder than a
piece of sun-baked clay, and by no means so hard as brick.
One circumstance appeared inexplicable to Réaumur and
his friend Du Hamel, who studied the operations of these
insects in concert. After taking a portion of sand from one
part of the garden-walk, the bees usually took another
portion from a spot almost twenty and sometimes a hundred
paces off, though the sand, so far as could be judged by
close examination, was precisely the same in the two places.
We should be disposed to refer this more to the restless
character of the insect than to any difference in the sand.
We have observed a wasp paring the outside of a plank, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
materials to form its nest; and though the plank was as
uniform in the qualities of its surface, nay, probably more
so than the sand could be, the wasp fidgeted about, nibbling
a fibre from one, and a fibre from another portion, till
enough was procured for one load. In the same way, the
whole tribe of wasps and bees flit restlessly from flower to
flower, not unfrequently revisiting the same blossom, again
and again, within a few seconds. It appears to us, indeed,
to be far from improbable, that this very restlessness and
irritability may be one of the springs of their unceasing
industry.</p>

<p>By observing, with some care, the bees which we found
digging the clay, we discovered one of them (<i>Osmia bicornis</i>)
at work upon a nest, about a gunshot from the bank. The
place it had chosen was the inner wall of a coal-house,
facing the south-west, the brick-work of which was but
roughly finished. In an upright interstice of half an inch
in width, between two of the bricks, we found the little
architect assiduously building its walls. The bricklayer&rsquo;s
mortar had either partly fallen out, or been removed by the
bee, who had commenced building at the lower end, and
did not build downwards, as the social wasps construct
their cells.</p>

<p>The very different behaviour of the insect here, and at
the quarry, struck us as not a little remarkable. When
digging and preparing the clay, our approach, however
near, produced no alarm; the work went on as if we had
been at a distance; and though we were standing close to
the hole, this did not scare away any of the bees upon their
arrival to procure a fresh load. But if we stood near the
nest, or even in the way by which the bee flew to it, she
turned back or made a wide circuit immediately, as if afraid
to betray the site of her domicile. We even observed her
turning back, when we were so distant that it could not
reasonably be supposed she was jealous of us; but probably
she had detected some prowling insect depredator, tracking
her flight with designs upon her provision for her future
progeny. We imagined we could perceive not a little art
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
in her jealous caution, for she would alight on the tiles as
if to rest herself; and even when she had entered the coal-house,
she did not go directly to her nest, but again rested
on a shelf, and at other times pretended to examine several
crevices in the wall, at some distance from the nest. But
when there was nothing to alarm her, she flew directly to
the spot, and began eagerly to add to the building.</p>

<p>It is in instances such as these, which exhibit the adaptation
of instinct to circumstances, that our reason finds the
greatest difficulty in explaining the governing principle of
the minds of the inferior animals. The mason-bee makes
her nest by an invariable rule; the model is in her mind,
as it has been in the mind of her race from their first creation:
they have learnt nothing by experience. But the
mode in which they accomplish this task varies according
to the situations in which they are placed. They appear to
have a glimmering of reason, employed as an accessary and
instrument of their instinct.</p>

bricks, and in the third, by <i>Megachile muraria</i> in the fluting of an old pilaster.&mdash;About
half the natural size.</div>
</div>

<p>The structure, when finished, consisted of a wall of clay
supported by two contiguous bricks, enclosing six chambers,
within each of which a mass of pollen, rather larger than a
cherry-stone, was deposited, together with an egg, from
which in due time a grub was hatched. Contrary to what
has been recorded by preceding naturalists with respect to
other mason-bees, we found the cells in this instance quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
parallel and perpendicular; but it may also be remarked,
that the bee itself was a species altogether different from
the one which we have described above as the <i>Anthophora
retusa</i>, and agreed with the figure of the one we caught
quarrying the clay&mdash;(<i>Osmia bicornis</i>).</p>

<p>[In Mr. F. Smith&rsquo;s elaborate catalogue of the British
hymenoptera there is a most interesting account of the
habits of this insect, which is the most abundant species of
the genus, and is spread not only over the whole of England,
but over the continent, being found as far south as Italy and
as far north as Lapland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a hilly country, or at the sea-side, it chooses the sunny
side of cliffs or sandy banks in which to form its burrows,
but in cultivated districts, particularly if the soil be clayey,
it selects a decayed tree, preferring the stump of an old
willow. It lays up a store of pollen and honey for the
larvæ, which when full grown, spins a tough dark brown
cocoon, in which they remain in the larval state until the
autumn, when the majority change to pupæ, and soon arrive
at their perfect condition. Many, however, pass the winter
in the larva state. In attempting to account for so remarkable
a circumstance, all must be conjecture, but it is not of unfrequent
occurrence. This species frequently makes its burrows
in the mortar of old walls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another species (<i>Osmia bicolor</i>) sometimes makes its cells
in very peculiar situations. When obliged to have recourse
to its natural powers, it uses its limbs right well, attacks
the hard sandy banks, and works at them with the greatest
perseverance. But it will not work one stroke where it can
avoid the necessity, and in many cases, it contrives to avoid
work with much ingenuity.</p>

<p>Lying hidden under hedges, bushes, grass, and herbage,
are sure to be shells of various snails, such as the common
garden-snail, and the banded-snail, whose diversified shell is
the delight of children. These shells the bee thinks are as
good as ready-made burrows, and she uses them accordingly.</p>

<p>She goes to the end of the shell, carrying her materials
with her, and then builds a cell, and fills it with pollen and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
honey. Another cell is then made, and yet another, until the
shell is nearly filled. As the shell widens, the <i>Osmia</i> places
two cells side by side, and when the insect has worked
within a short distance of the mouth, she places the cells
horizontally, so as to fill up the space. There are several
specimens of these curious habitations in the British
Museum.</p>

<p>When the whole series of cells is completed, the bee closes
up the entrance with little morsels of earth, bits of stick and
little stones, all strongly glued together with some very
adhesive substance.</p>

<p>Another species (<i>Osmia parietina</i>) has much simpler
habits, and is much easier satisfied with a dwelling. This
insect merely looks out for a flattish stone lying on the
ground, and crawls under it to see if there is any hollow. If
so, it attaches the cocoons to the stone and leaves them. On
one stone, seen in the British Museum, no less than two
hundred and thirty cocoons were placed, although the stone
is only ten inches in length by six in width.</p>

<p>This insect is almost wholly confined to the north of
England.]</p>

<p>There was one circumstance attending the proceedings of
this mason-bee which struck us not a little, though we could
not explain it to our own satisfaction. Every time she left
her nest for the purpose of procuring a fresh supply of
materials, she paid a regular visit to the blossoms of a lilac-tree
which grew near. Had these blossoms afforded a supply
of pollen, with which she could have replenished her cells,
we could have easily understood her design; but the pollen
of the lilac is not suitable for this purpose, and that she had
never used it was proved by all the pollen in the cells being
yellow, whereas that of the lilac is of the same pale purple
colour as the flowers. Besides, she did not return immediately
from the lilac-tree to the building, but always went
for a load of clay. There seemed to us, therefore, to be only
two ways to explain the circumstance:&mdash;she must either have
applied to the lilac-blossoms to obtain a refreshment of
honey, or to procure glutinous materials to mix with the clay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>When employed upon the building itself, the bee exhibited
the restless disposition peculiar to most hymenopterous<a name="FNanchor_P" id="FNanchor_P"></a><a href="#Footnote_P" class="fnanchor">[P]</a>
insects; for she did not go on with one particular portion of
her wall, but ran about from place to place every time she
came to work. At first, when we saw her running from the
bottom to the top of her building, we naturally imagined that
she went up for some of the bricklayer&rsquo;s mortar to mix with
her own materials; but upon minutely examining the walls
afterwards, no lime could be discovered in their structure
similar to that which was apparent in the nest found in the
wall of Greenwich Park.</p>

<p>Réaumur mentions another sort of mason-bee, which selects
a small cavity in a stone, in which she forms her nest of
garden-mould moistened with gluten, and afterwards closes
the whole with the same material.</p>

<p>[In the accompanying illustration is shown a series of cells
which are constructed by an insect which is closely related to
the rose-cutter bee of our own country, to which it bears a
close resemblance.</p>

<p>It is a native of South Africa, and its name is <i>Chalicodoma
c&oelig;locerus</i>. The insect is about half an inch in length, and the
colour of the head and body is black, that of the abdomen
being brick red.</p>

<p>The nest is made of mud, which is collected by the patient
insect and stuck against walls, trunks of trees, and similar
localities. In this lump of mud the insect excavates a small
number of burrows, each of which contains several cells. If
the reader will refer to the central burrow, he will see that it
is divided into three cells. The specimen from which this
drawing is taken may be seen in the British Museum.</p>

<p>There is another South African insect which makes its mud
nest, and fastens it against trees and walls. This is called
<i>Synagris calida</i>, and its colour is almost dingy black, the only
exception being the red tip to the abdomen. The holes seen
in the engraving are the apertures through which the young
brood has escaped into the world. The nest is represented

<p class="caption3 smcap">Mining-Bees.</p>

<p>A very small sort of bees (<i>Andrenæ</i>), many of them not
larger than a house-fly, dig in the ground tubular galleries
little wider than the diameter of their own bodies. Samouelle
says, that all of them seem to prefer a southern aspect; but
we have found them in banks facing the east, and even the
north. Immediately above the spot where we have described
the mason-bees quarrying the clay, we observed several holes,
about the diameter of the stalk of a tobacco-pipe, into which
those little bees were seen passing. The clay here was very
hard; and on passing a straw into the hole as a director, and
digging down for six or eight inches, a very smooth circular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
gallery was found, terminating in a thimble-shaped horizontal
chamber, almost at right angles to the entrance and nearly
twice as wide. In this chamber there was a ball of bright
yellow pollen, as round as a garden pea, and rather larger,
upon which a small white grub was feeding; and to which
the mother bee had been adding, as she had just entered a
minute before with her thighs loaded with pollen. That it
was not the male, the load of pollen determined; for the male
has no apparatus for collecting or transporting it. The whole
labour of digging the nest and providing food for the young is
performed by the female. The females of the solitary bees
have no assistance in their tasks. The males are idle; and
the females are unprovided with labourers, such as the queens
of the hive command.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Cell of Mining-Bee (<i>Andrena</i>).&mdash;About half the natural size.</div>
</div>

<p>Réaumur mentions that the bees of this sort, whose operations
he had observed, piled up at the entrance of their
galleries the earth which they had scooped out from the
interior; and when the grub was hatched, and properly
provided with food, the earth was again employed to close up
the passage, in order to prevent the intrusion of ants, ichneumon-flies,
or other depredators. In those which we have
observed, this was not the case; but every species differs
from another in some little peculiarity, though they agree in
the general principles of their operations.</p>

<p>[The genus Andrena is an exceedingly large one, nearly
seventy species being acknowledged in England alone. They
choose various situations for their nest; a very favourite
situation is a hard-trodden pathway; into this the bees
burrow for some six or seven inches, and often drive their
tunnels to a depth of ten inches. Digging up these habitations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
is not a very easy task, because the tunnel does not
run straight, but turns aside when a stone or any similar
obstacle comes in the way, and in getting out the stone the
burrow is mostly broken. The only method of digging out
the nest successfully is either by pushing a small twig up
the hole, and using it as a guide, or by filling the entire hole
with cotton wool, so as to prevent the earth from falling in.</p>

<p>The commonest species is <i>Andrena albicans</i>. Its length is
rather less than half an inch, and its colour is black, with a
thick coating of rich red hair on the upper part of the thorax.
This species is plentiful on the continent, and is found as far
south as Italy. But it is equally capable of enduring great
cold, as it has been captured in the Arctic regions. Sometimes
the bee will not trouble itself to make a number of
separate burrows, but will drive short supplementary tunnels
from the side of the first burrow, so that they all open into
one common entrance.</p>

<p>The Andrenæ are remarkable for the parasites with which
they are infested, the most curious of which is that tiny
strepsipterous insect called the Stylops.</p>

<p>One of the Andrenæ, called <i>Colletes Daviesana</i>, is remarkable
for the character of its burrow. Like many of the
insects which have already been described, it seems indifferent
whether it burrows in sand-banks or into the mortar
of walls, provided that in the latter case the mortar is soft
and friable.</p>

<p>The insect burrows a hole which is very deep in proportion
to its size, the little bee being only the third of an inch in
length, and the burrows some eight or ten inches in depth.
When the mother <i>Colletes</i> has finished her tunnel, she lines the
end of it with a thin kind of membrane, which has been well
compared by Mr. F. Smith to goldbeater&rsquo;s skin. This lining
is intended to enable the bee to store honey in the cell, as, if
there were no such protection, the honey would soak in the
ground and be lost.</p>

<p>Having stored up enough food for a single offspring, she
shuts it off by a partition of the same membranous substance as
the lining. Her next care is to make a thimble-like cup at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the end, so as to have a double lining where the honey is to
come, and then she puts a fresh supply in the new cell.
This cell is then closed, and the bee proceeds with her work
until she has made from six to eight cells in a single burrow.
This insect suffers terribly from the depredations of the earwig,
which completely empties the burrow both of food and
of inhabitants. The colour of the insect is black, with a
little reddish down on the upper part of the thorax, and some
white on the legs. The abdomen is shining black, but each
segment has a very narrow band of reddish down on its edge.</p>

<p>In 1850, Mr. F. Smith, to whose works such constant
reference has been made, undertook the study of a genus of
mining-bees belonging to this family. The species which he
chiefly watched is <i>Halictus morio</i>, and his observations are
peculiarly valuable, as showing the wonderful manner in
which the economy of the race is managed. It is known
that in these and many other insects, the pregnant females
pass the winter in a state of hibernation, and begin to work
in the following spring, and that therefore some arrangement
must be needful that a supply of such queens should be kept
up.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith found the case to stand thus. Early in April,
the females appeared abundantly, and could be seen until
June, but not a single male was to be found. During June
and July, almost all the <i>Halicti</i> had disappeared, the reason
being, that the queens had made their burrows, laid their
eggs, stocked their cells, and then died, the duties of their
life having been fulfilled. In the middle of August, the
males began to appear, and in September the females of the
first brood came out. They immediately set to work at their
burrows, and laid their eggs. The ground, thoroughly
warmed by the summer sun, soon hastened the young through
their changes, and in an incredibly short time the insects of
the second brood made their appearance. The females of
this brood meet their mates, and then hide themselves until the
following spring.</p>

<p>As in the case of Andrenæ, several tunnels are often made
with one common entrance. The insect is very small,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
scarcely exceeding the sixth of an inch in length. The head
and thorax are a dark green, the abdomen is white, and the
legs are covered with silvery hairs. It is a plentiful insect,
and is found haunting the holes of old walls.</p>

<p>Passing to another family of British mining-bees, we come
to one species that is remarkable not only for its form, but
for its economy. This is the <i>Eucera longicornis</i>, the only
known species that inhabits England. In form it is chiefly
remarkable from the fact that the antennæ of the male are as
long as the entire body. The pupa of this insect is enclosed
in a thin membrane, and when the male insect is about to
emerge from its pupal shell, it has recourse to a rather
curious expedient. At the base of the first joint of the front
feet there is a bold notch. When the insect wishes to
remove the thin membranous pellicle which envelopes the
antennæ, it lays these organs in the notch, draws them
through, and thus easily strips off the pellicle. The antennæ
are most beautifully formed, the surface of each joint being
marked with an elaborate pattern like net-work, so that they
form beautiful objects for the microscope.</p>

<p>The soil preferred by the <i>Eucera</i> is of a clayey nature.
When it has completed the burrow, it presses the soil at the
extremity with all its might, and smooths it so carefully
that the burrow becomes capable of holding honey without
needing any lining. The insect is generally found about the
end of May or beginning of June, and in some places is
found in great numbers. The ground colour of the insect is
black, but the body is covered with a coating of short dun
hairs. The length rather exceeds half an inch.]</p>

<p class="caption2">CARPENTER-BEES; CARPENTER-WASPS; UPHOLSTERER-BEES.</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Carpenter-Bees.</p>

<p>Among the solitary bees are several British species, which
come under that class called carpenter-bees by M.
Réaumur, from the circumstance of their working in wood, as
the mason-bees work in stone. We have frequently witnessed
the operations of these ingenious little workers, who are
particularly partial to posts, palings, and the wood-work of
houses which has become soft by beginning to decay. Wood
actually decayed, or affected by dry-rot, they seem to reject
as unfit for their purposes; but they make no objections to
any hole previously drilled, provided it be not too large; and,
like the mason-bees, they not unfrequently take possession of
an old nest, a few repairs being all that in this case is
necessary.</p>

<p>When a new nest is to be constructed, the bee proceeds to
chisel sufficient space for it out of the wood with her jaws.
We say <i>her</i>, because the task in this instance, as in most
others of solitary bees and wasps, devolves solely upon the
female, the male taking no concern in the affair, and probably
being altogether ignorant that such a work is going forward.
It is, at least, certain that the male is never seen giving his
assistance, and he seldom, if ever, approaches the neighbourhood.
The female carpenter-bee has a task to perform no
less arduous than the mason-bee; for though the wood may
be tolerably soft, she can only cut out a very small portion
at a time. The successive portions which she gnaws off may
be readily ascertained by an observer, as she carries them
away from the place. In giving the history of a mason-wasp
(<i>Odynerus</i>), at page 22, we remarked the care with
which she carried to a distance little fragments of brick,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
which she detached in the progress of excavation. We have
recently watched a precisely similar procedure in the instance
of a carpenter-bee forming a cell in a wooden post. (J. R.)
The only difference was, that the bee did not fly so far away
with her fragments of wood as the wasp did; but she varied
the direction of her flight every time: and we could observe
that, after dropping, the chip of wood which she had carried
off, she did not return in a direct line to her nest, but made
a circuit of some extent before wheeling round to go back.</p>

<p>On observing the proceedings of this carpenter-bee next
day, we found her coming in with balls of pollen on her
thighs; and on tracing her from the nest into the adjacent
garden, we saw her visiting every flower which was likely to
yield her a supply of pollen for her future progeny. This
was not all; we subsequently saw her taking the direction
of the clay quarry frequented by the mason-bees, as we have
mentioned in page 41, where we recognised her loading herself
with a pellet of clay, and carrying it into her cell in the
wooden post. We observed her alternating this labour for
several days, at one time carrying clay, and at another
pollen; till at length she completed her task, and closed the
entrance with a barricade of clay, to prevent the intrusion of
any insectivorous depredator, who might make prey of her
young; or of some prying parasite, who might introduce its
own eggs into the nest she had taken so much trouble to
construct.</p>

<p>Some days after it was finished, we cut into the post, and
exposed this nest to view. It consisted of six cells of a
somewhat square shape, the wood forming the lateral walls;
and each was separated from the one adjacent by a partition
of clay, of the thickness of a playing card. The wood was
not lined with any extraneous substance, but was worked as
smooth as if it had been chiseled by a joiner. There were
five cells, arranged in a very singular manner&mdash;two being
almost horizontal, two perpendicular, and one oblique.</p>

<p>The depth to which the wood was excavated in this instance
was considerably less than what we have observed in
other species which dig perpendicular galleries several inches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
deep in posts and garden-seats; and they are inferior in
ingenuity to the carpentry of a bee described by Réaumur
(<i>Xylocopa violacea</i>), which has not been ascertained to be a
native of Britain, though a single indigenous species of the
genus has been doubtingly mentioned, and is figured by
Kirby and Spence, in their valuable &lsquo;Monographia.&rsquo; If it
ever be found here, its large size and beautiful violet-coloured
wings will render mistakes impossible.</p>

In fig. A the cells contain the young grubs; in fig. B the cells are empty. Both figures

</div>

<p>The violet carpenter-bee usually selects an upright piece
of wood, into which she bores obliquely for about an inch;
and then, changing the direction, works perpendicularly, and
parallel to the sides of the wood, from twelve or fifteen
inches, and half an inch in breadth. Sometimes the bee is
contented with one or two of these excavations; at other
times, when the wood is adapted to it, she scoops out three
or four&mdash;a task which sometimes requires several weeks of
incessant labour.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 375px;">

</div>

<p>The tunnel in the wood, however, is only one part of the
work; for the little architect has afterwards to divide the
whole into cells, somewhat less than an inch in depth. It is
necessary, for the proper growth of her progeny, that each
should be separated from the other, and be provided with
adequate food. She knows, most exactly, the quantity of
food which each grub will require during its growth; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
she therefore does not hesitate to cut it off from any additional
supply. In constructing her cells, she does not employ
clay, like the bee which we have mentioned above, but the
sawdust, if we may call it so, which she has collected in
gnawing out the gallery. It would not, therefore, have
suited her design to scatter this about, as our carpenter-bee
did. The violet-bee, on the contrary, collects her gnawings
into a little store-heap for future use, at a short distance
from her nest. She proceeds thus:&mdash;At the bottom of her
excavation she deposits an egg, and over it fills a space nearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
an inch high with the pollen of flowers, made into a paste
with honey. She then covers this over with a ceiling composed
of cemented sawdust, which also serves for the floor
of the next chamber above it. For this purpose she cements
round a wall a ring of wood-chips taken from her store-heap;
and within this ring forms another, gradually contracting
the diameter till she has constructed a circular plate,
about the thickness of a crown-piece, and of considerable
hardness. This plate of course exhibits concentric circles,
somewhat similar to the annual circles in the cross section of
a tree. In the same manner she proceeds till she has completed
ten or twelve cells; and then she closes the main
entrance with a barrier of similar materials.</p>

<p>Let us compare the progress of this little joiner with a
human artisan&mdash;one who has been long practised in his trade,
and has the most perfect and complicated tools for his
assistance. The bee has learnt nothing by practice; she
makes her nest but once in her life, but it is then as complete
and finished as if she had made a thousand. She has no
pattern before her&mdash;but the Architect of all things has impressed
a plan upon her mind, which she can realize without
scale or compasses. Her two sharp teeth are the only tools
with which she is provided for her laborious work; and yet
she bores a tunnel, twelve times the length of her own body,
with greater ease than the workman who bores into the earth
for water, with his apparatus of augurs adapted to every soil.
Her tunnel is clean and regular; she leaves no chips at the
bottom, for she is provident of her materials. Further, she
has an exquisite piece of joinery to perform when her ruder
labour is accomplished. The patient bee works her rings
from the circumference to the centre, and she produces a
shelf, united with such care with her natural glue, that a
number of fragments are as solid as one piece.</p>

<p>The violet carpenter-bee, as may be expected, occupies
several weeks in these complicated labours; and during that
period she is gradually depositing her eggs, each of which is
successively to become a grub, a pupa, and a perfect bee.
It is obvious, therefore, as she does not lay all her eggs in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the same place&mdash;as each is separated from the other by a
laborious process&mdash;that the egg which is first laid will be
the earliest hatched; and that the first perfect insect, being
older than its fellows in the same tunnel, will strive to make
its escape sooner, and so on of the rest. The careful mother
provides for this contingency. She makes a lateral opening
at the bottom of the cells; for the teeth of the young bees
would not be strong enough to pierce the outer wood, though
they can remove the cemented rings of sawdust in the interior.
Réaumur observed these holes, in several cases; and he
further noticed another external opening opposite to the
middle cell, which he supposed was formed, in the first
instance, to shorten the distance for the removal of the
fragments of wood in the lower half of the building.</p>

<p class="tb_stars">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>That bees of similar habits, if not the same species as the
violet-bee, are indigenous to this country, is proved by Grew,
who mentions, in his &lsquo;Rarities of Gresham College,&rsquo; having
found a series of such cells in the middle of the pith of an
elder branch, in which they were placed lengthwise, one after
another, with a thin boundary between each. As he does not,
however, tell us that he was acquainted with the insect which
constructed these, it might as probably be allied to the
<i>Ceratina albilabris</i>, of which Spinola has given so interesting
an account in the &lsquo;Annales du Muséum d&rsquo;Histoire Naturelle&rsquo;
(x. 236). This noble and learned naturalist tells us, that one
evening he perceived a female ceratina alight on the branch
of a bramble, partly withered, and of which the extremity had
been broken; and, after resting a moment, suddenly disappear.
On detaching the branch, he found that it was perforated, and
that the insect was in the very act of excavating a nidus for
her eggs. He forthwith gathered a bundle of branches, both
of the bramble and the wild-rose, similarly perforated, and
took them home to examine them at leisure. Upon inspection,
he found that the nests were furnished like those of the
same tribe, with balls of pollen kneaded with honey, as a
provision for the grubs.</p>

<p>The female ceratina selects a branch of the bramble or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
wild-rose which has been accidentally broken, and digs into
the pith only, leaving the wood and bark untouched. Her
mandibles, indeed, are not adapted for gnawing wood; and,
accordingly, he found instances in which she could not finish
her nest in branches of the wild-rose, where the pith was not
of sufficient diameter.</p>

<p>The insect usually makes her perforation a foot in depth,
and divides this into eight, nine, or even twelve cells, each
about five lines long, and separated by partitions formed by
the gnawings of the pith, cemented by honey, or some similar
glutinous fluid, much in the same manner with the <i>Xylocopa
violacea</i>, which we have already described.</p>

<p>[This species is probably <i>Ceratina cærulea</i>, as the second
species, <i>C. albilabris</i>, seems to have little claim to be considered
as a British insect. It is plentiful in spots where it resides,
but is very local. It can best be found by collecting all the
specimens of bramble branches that have holes bored into the
pith.</p>

<p>Mr. F. Smith says of this tiny bee, &ldquo;Some years ago I
observed a small bee most industriously employed in excavating
a dead bramble stick. My attention was directed to the
circumstance from observing some of the fallen pieces of
pith on the ground immediately beneath. Occasionally fresh
quantities of dust were pushed out. At length, the little
creature came out of the stick as if to rest, and after sunning
itself for a few minutes, it re-entered, and again commenced
its labours. Later in the day, after stopping up the entrance,
I cut off the branch and found in it a male and female
ceratina.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ceratina is only the sixth of an inch in length, and is
deep shining blue in colour.</p>

<p>There are many other species of British bees which frequent
the stems of bramble and other trees. One of them is known
as <i>Prosopis signata</i>. The cells made by the bees of this genus
are lined with a membrane, and are stocked with liquid honey.
Some species will not take the trouble of boring a tunnel for
themselves, but will make use of hollow stones, or similar
localities, and place in them the silk-covered cocoons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>There are species of that versatile genus <i>Osmia</i>
(<i>O. leucomelana</i>), in the habit of burrowing into dead bramble
branches. The mother insect bores a hole some six inches in
length, throwing the pieces of pith away, and then, depositing
at the bottom an egg and a supply of food, she forms a
cell by fixing across the burrow a stopper made of masticated
leaves.</p>

<p>The stopper retains its place firmly, because the bee does
not eat away the whole of the pith, but alternately widens and
contracts the diameter of the burrow, each contracted portion
being the termination of a cell. The perfect insect appears
in the early summer of the following year.]</p>

<p class="caption3 smcap">Carpenter-Wasps.</p>

<p>As there are mason-wasps similar in economy to mason-bees,
so are there solitary carpenter-wasps which dig galleries
in timber, and partition them out into several cells by means
of the gnawings of the wood which they have detached. This
sort of wasp is of the genus <i>Eumenes</i>. The wood selected is
generally such as is soft, or in a state of decay; and the hole
which is dug in it is much less neat and regular than that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the carpenter-bees, while the division of the chambers is
nothing more than the rubbish produced during the excavation.</p>

<p>The provision which is made for the grub consists of flies
or gnats piled into the chamber, but without the nice order
remarkable in the spiral columns of green caterpillars
provided by the mason-wasp (<i>Odynerus murarius</i>). The most
remarkable circumstance is, that in some of the species, when
the grub is about to go into the pupa state, it spins a case (a
cocoon), into which it interweaves the wings of the flies
whose bodies it has previously devoured. In other species,
the gnawings of the wood are employed in a similar manner.</p>

<p>[Some of the solitary wasps are also carpenters, and the
genus <i>Crabro</i> has several species which are classed under
this head. There is, for example, <i>Crabro clavipes</i>, a little
black insect with red and black abdomen, that burrows into
dead bramble sticks, boring out the pith, and forming a
series of cells in the narrow tube thus made. Sometimes
this insect bores into decaying wood, but its general home
is the bramble-stick. The same habits are common to several
other British species of this genus, and the reader will find
that old, decaying willow trees are chiefly visited by these
pretty little insects. Their store of food, which they lay up
for their young, mostly consists of dipterous insects, and
various species of gnats are used for this purpose.</p>

<p>Another of the carpenter-wasps (<i>Pemphredon lugubris</i>) is
really a useful insect. It makes its burrows in posts,
rails, and similar localities, and provides its future young
with a large stock of aphides. It has been seen to settle on
a rose-bush, scrape off the branches a number of aphides,
form them into a ball, and carry them off between its head
and front legs.</p>

<p>The colour of this insect is dull black, from which circumstance
it derives its name of <i>lugubris.</i> The head is large,
and squared, and the abdomen is attached to the thorax by
a large footstalk. Its length is about half an inch. It is a
very common insect, and is believed to be the only British
representation of its genus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Several species do not take the trouble to form a burrow
for themselves, but content themselves with building in holes
ready made for them. Straws are favourite resorts of such
insects, and in thatched buildings the straws of the roof
are often filled with their cells.</p>

<p>One of these insects is a very little species, barely a
quarter of an inch in length. Its colour is black, with some
silver white hair on the face, and the legs are paler than the
body. The abdomen has a long footstalk. Its scientific name
is <i>Psen pallipes</i>. Like the insect which has just been described,
it provisions its young with aphides.]</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Upholsterer-Bees.</p>

<p>In another part of this volume we shall see how certain
caterpillars construct abodes for themselves, by cutting off
portions of the leaves or bark of plants, and uniting them
by means of silk into a uniform and compact texture; but
this scarcely appears so wonderful as the prospective labours
of some species of bees for the lodgment of their progeny.
We allude to the solitary bees, known by the name of the
leaf-cutting bees, but which may be denominated more
generally <i>upholsterer-bees</i>, as there are some of them which
use other materials beside leaves.</p>

<p>One species of our little upholsterers has been called the
poppy-bee (<i>Osmia papaveris</i>, <span class="smcap">Latr.</span>), from its selecting the
scarlet petals of the poppy as tapestry for its cells. Kirby
and Spence express their doubts whether it is indigenous to
this country: we are almost certain that we have seen the
nests in Scotland. (J. R.) At Largs, in Ayrshire, a beautiful
sea-bathing village on the Firth of Clyde, in July, 1814, we
found in a footpath a great number of the cylindrical perforations
of the poppy-bee. [In his catalogue of British
Hymenoptera, Mr. F. Smith makes the following remarks
with regard to this insect. "The poppy-bee, <i>Anthocopa
papaveris</i>, is closely allied to this genus (<i>Osmia</i>), and may
indeed be placed before it as a connecting link with the
<i>Osmia</i>. This interesting insect (<i>l&rsquo;abeille Tapissiere</i>), of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Réaumur, has been supposed to inhabit this country, specimens
having been placed in the collection at the British
Museum. But it was with much regret that I discovered,
when engaged upon the catalogue of British bees for the
Museum, and had occasion to examine each individual
specimen with care, that in the first place there was no
satisfactory evidence of the locality, and that in the next
place, all the males associated with the series were those of
<i>Osmia adunca</i>, of Panzear." For these reasons, this species
has been excluded from the list of British bees.] Réaumur
remarked that the cells of this bee which he found at Bercy,
were situated in a northern exposure, contrary to what he
had remarked in the mason-bee, which prefers the south.
The cells at Largs, however, were on an elevated bank,
facing the south, near Sir Thomas Brisbane&rsquo;s observatory.
With respect to exposure, indeed, no certain rule seems
applicable; for the nests of mason-bees which we found on
the wall of Greenwich Park faced the north-east, and we have
often found carpenter-bees make choice of a similar situation.
In one instance, we found carpenter-bees working indifferently
on the north-east and south-west side of the same post.</p>

<p>As we did not perceive any heaps of earth near the holes
at Largs, we concluded that it must either have been carried
off piecemeal when they were dug, or that they were old
holes re-occupied (a circumstance common with bees), and
that the rubbish had been trodden down by passengers.
Réaumur, who so minutely describes the subsequent operations
of the bee, says nothing respecting its excavations.
One of these holes is about three inches deep, gradually
widening as it descends, till it assumes the form of a small
Florence flask. The interior of this is rendered smooth,
uniform, and polished, in order to adapt it to the tapestry
with which it is intended to be hung, and which is the next
step in the process.</p>

<p>The material used for tapestry by the insect upholsterer
is supplied by the flower-leaves of the scarlet field-poppy,
from which she successively cuts off small pieces of an oval
shape, seizes them between her legs, and conveys them to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the nest. She begins her work at the bottom, which she
overlays with three or four leaves in thickness, and the sides
have never less than two. When she finds that the piece
she has brought is too large to fit the place intended, she
cuts off what is superfluous, and carries away the shreds.
By cutting the fresh petal of a poppy with a pair of scissors,
we may perceive the difficulty of keeping the piece free from
wrinkles and shrivelling; but the bee knows how to spread
the pieces which she uses as smooth as glass.</p>

<p>When she has in this manner hung the little chamber
all around with this splendid scarlet tapestry, of which she
is not sparing, but extends it even beyond the entrance,
she then fills it with the pollen of flowers mixed with honey,
to the height of about half an inch. In this magazine of
provisions for her future progeny she lays an egg, and over
it folds down the tapestry of poppy-petals from above. The
upper part is then filled in with earth; but Latreille says
he has observed more than one cell constructed in a single
excavation. This may account for Réaumur&rsquo;s describing
them as sometimes seven inches deep; a circumstance which
Latreille, however, thinks very surprising.</p>

<p>It will, perhaps, be impossible ever to ascertain, beyond
a doubt, whether the tapestry-bee is led to select the brilliant
petals of the poppy from their colour, or from any
other quality they may possess, of softness or of warmth,
for instance. Réaumur thinks that the largeness, united
with the flexibility of the poppy-leaves, determines her
choice. Yet it is not improbable that her eye may be
gratified by the appearance of her nest; that she may
possess a feeling of the beautiful in colour, and may look
with complacency upon the delicate hangings of the apartment
which she destines for her offspring. Why should
not an insect be supposed to have a glimmering of the value
of ornament? How can we pronounce, from our limited
notion of the mode in which the inferior animals think and
act, that their gratifications are wholly bounded by the
positive utility of the objects which surround them? Why
does a dog howl at the sound of a bugle, but because it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
offends his organ of hearing?&mdash;and why, therefore, may not
a bee feel gladness in the brilliant hues of her scarlet
drapery, because they are grateful to her organs of sight?
All these little creatures work, probably, with more neatness
and finish than is absolutely essential for comfort; and
this circumstance alone would imply that they have something
of taste to exhibit, which produces to them a pleasurable
emotion.</p>

<p>The tapestry-bee is, however, content with ornamenting
the interior only of the nest which she forms for her
progeny. She does not misplace her embellishments with
the error of some human artists. She desires security as
well as elegance; and, therefore, she leaves no external
traces of her operations. Hers is not a mansion rich with
columns and friezes without, but cold and unfurnished
within, like the desolate palaces of Venice. She covers
her tapestry quite round with the common earth; and
leaves her eggs enclosed in their poppy-case with a certainty
that the outward show of her labours will attract
no plunderer.</p>

<p>The poppy-bee may be known by its being rather
more than a third of an inch long, of a black colour,
studded on the head and back with reddish-grey hairs;
the belly being grey and silky, and the rings margined
with grey above, the second and third having an impressed
transversal line.</p>

<p class="tb_stars">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>A species of solitary bee (<i>Anthidium manicatum</i>, <span class="smcap">Fabricius</span>),
by no means uncommon with us, forms a nest of a peculiarly
interesting structure. Kirby and Spence say, that it does
not excavate holes, but makes choice of the cavities of old
trees, key-holes, and similar localities; yet it is highly
probable, we think, that it may sometimes scoop out a
suitable cavity when it cannot find one; for its mandibles
seem equally capable of this, with those of any of the carpenter
or mason-bees.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, the bee in question having selected
a place suitably sheltered from the weather, and from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the intrusion of depredators, proceeds to form her nest,
the exterior walls of which she forms of the wool of
pubescent plants, such as rose-campion (<i>Lychnis coronaria</i>),
the quince (<i>Pyrus cydonia</i>), cats-ears (<i>Stachys lunata</i>), &amp;c.
&ldquo;It is very pleasant,&rdquo; says Mr. White, of Selborne, &ldquo;to see
with what address this insect strips off the down, running
from the top to the bottom of the branch, and shaving it
bare with all the dexterity of a hoop-shaver. When it has
got a vast bundle, almost as large as itself, it flies away,
holding it secure between its chin and its fore-legs.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_Q" id="FNanchor_Q"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> The
material is rolled up like a ribbon; and we possess a specimen
in which one of these rolls still adheres to a rose-campion
stem, the bee having been scared away before
obtaining her load.</p>

<p>The manner in which the cells of the nest are made
seems not to be very clearly understood. M. Latreille
says, that, after constructing her nest of the down of
quince-leaves, she deposits her eggs, together with a store
of paste, formed of the pollen of flowers, for nourishing the
grubs. Kirby and Spence, on the other hand, tell us, that
&ldquo;the parent bee, <i>after</i> having constructed her cells, laid an
egg in each, and filled them with a store of suitable food,
plasters them with a covering of vermiform masses, apparently
composed of honey and pollen; and having done
this, aware, long before Count Rumford&rsquo;s experiments, what
materials conduct heat most slowly,&rdquo; she collects the down
from woolly plants, and &ldquo;sticks it upon the plaster that
covers her cells, and thus closely envelops them with a
warm coating of down, impervious to every change of
temperature.&rdquo; &ldquo;From later observations,&rdquo; however, they
are "inclined to think that these cells may possibly, as in
the case of the humble-bee, be in fact formed by the larva
previously to becoming a pupa, after having eaten the
provision of pollen and honey with which the parent bee
had surrounded it. The vermicular shape, however, of the
masses with which the cases are surrounded, does not seem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
easily reconcilable with this supposition, unless they are
considered as the excrement of the larva."<a name="FNanchor_R" id="FNanchor_R"></a><a href="#Footnote_R" class="fnanchor">[R]</a></p>

<p>Whether or not this second explanation is the true
one, we have not the means of ascertaining; but we are
almost certain the first is incorrect, as it is contrary to the
regular procedure of insects to begin with the interior part
of any structure, and work outwards. We should imagine,
then, that the down is first spread out into the form required,
and afterwards plastered on the inside to keep it in form,
when probably the grub spins the vermicular cells previous
to its metamorphosis.</p>

<p>It might prove interesting to investigate this more
minutely; and as the bee is by no means scarce in the
neighbourhood of London, it might not be difficult for a
careful observer to witness all the details of this singular
architecture. Yet we have repeatedly endeavoured, but
without success, to watch the bees, when loaded with down,
to their nests. The bee may be readily known from its
congeners, by its being about the size of the hive-bee, but
more broad and flattened, blackish-brown above, with a row
of six yellow or white spots along each side of the rings,
very like the rose-leaf cutter, and having the belly covered
with yellowish-brown hair, and the legs fringed with long
hairs of a rather lighter colour.</p>

<p class="tb_stars">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>[This bee does not bore a tunnel for herself, but occupies
that of some other insect. The nests of this insect are
generally to be obtained from old willows, because these
trees are so largely bored by the goat-moth caterpillar, and
afford ample space for the larva. The woolly substance
obtained from the plant is pressed against the sides of the
burrow, so as to form a lining. She then makes a series of
cells of a similar material, and the young larva, when it is
about to change into the pupa state, envelops itself in a
silken covering of a brown colour.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact, that the male of this insect is considerably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
larger than the female, thus reversing the usual order
of things among insects. Only one species of this bee is
known in England.]</p>

<p>A common bee belonging to the family of upholsterers
is called the rose-leaf cutter (<i>Megachile centuncularis</i>, <span class="smcap">Latr.</span>).
The singularly ingenious habits of this bee have long
attracted the attention of naturalists; but the most interesting
description is given by Réaumur. So extraordinary does
the construction of their nests appear, that a French gardener
having dug up some, and believing them to be the
work of a magician, who had placed them in his garden
with evil intent, sent them to Paris to his master, for advice
as to what should be done by way of exorcism. On applying
to the Abbé Nollet, the owner of the garden was soon persuaded
that the nests in question were the work of insects;
and M. Réaumur, to whom they were subsequently sent,
found them to be the nests of one of the upholsterer-bees,
and probably of the rose-leaf cutter, though the nests in
question were made of the leaves of the mountain ash
(<i>Pyrus aucuparia</i>).</p>

<p>The rose-leaf cutter makes a cylindrical hole in a beaten
pathway, for the sake of more consolidated earth (or in the
cavities of walls or decayed wood), from six to ten inches
deep, and does not throw the earth dug out from it into a
heap, like the Andrenæ.<a name="FNanchor_S" id="FNanchor_S"></a><a href="#Footnote_S" class="fnanchor">[S]</a> In this she constructs several
cells about an inch in length, shaped like a thimble, and
made of cuttings of leaves (not petals), neatly folded
together, the bottom of one thimble-shaped cell being
inserted into the mouth of the one below it, and so on in
succession.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 333px;">
<img src="images/071.png" width="333" height="402" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Rose-leaf cutter Bees, and Nest lined with rose-leaves.</div>
</div>

<p>It is interesting to observe the manner in which this
bee procures the materials for forming the tapestry of
her cells. The leaf of the rose-tree seems to be that which
she prefers, though she sometimes takes other sorts of leaves,
particularly those with serrated margins, such as the birch,
the perennial mercury (<i>Mercurialis perennis</i>), mountain-ash,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
&amp;c. She places herself upon the outer edge of the leaf
which she has selected, so that its margin may pass between
her legs. Turning her head towards the point, she commences
near the footstalk, and with her mandibles cuts
out a circular piece with as much expedition as we could
do with a pair of scissors, and with more accuracy and
neatness than could easily be done by us. As she proceeds,
she keeps the cut portion between her legs, so as not to
impede her progress; and using her body for a <i>trammel</i>, as
a carpenter would say, she cuts in a regular curved line.
As she supports herself during the operation upon the
portion of the leaf which she is detaching, it must be
obvious, when it is nearly cut off, that the weight of her
body might tear it away, so as to injure the accuracy of its
curvilineal shape. To prevent any accident of this kind,
as soon as she suspects that her weight might tear it, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
poises herself on her wings, till she has completed the
incision. It has been said, by naturalists, that this man&oelig;uvre
of poising herself on the wing, is to prevent her
falling to the ground, when the piece gives way; but as no
winged insect requires to take any such precaution, our
explanation is probably the true one.</p>

<p>With the piece which she has thus cut out, held in a bent
position perpendicularly to her body, she flies off to her
nest, and fits it into the interior with the utmost neatness
and ingenuity; and, without employing any paste or glue,
she trusts, as Réaumur ascertained, to the spring the leaf
takes in drying, to retain it in its position. It requires
from nine to ten pieces of leaf to form one cell, as they are
not always of precisely the same thickness. The interior
surface of each cell consists of three pieces of leaf, of equal
size, narrow at one end, but gradually widening at the other,
where the width equals half the length. One side of each
of the pieces is the serrated margin of the leaf from which
it was cut, and this margin is always placed outermost, and
the cut margin innermost. Like most insects, she begins
with the exterior, commencing with a layer of tapestry,
which is composed of three or four oval pieces, larger in
dimensions than the rest, adding a second and a third layer
proportionately smaller. In forming these, she is careful
not to place a joining opposite to a joining, but with all the
skill of a consummate artificer, lays the middle of each piece
of leaf over the margins of the others, so as by this means
both to cover and strengthen the junctions. By repeating
this process, she sometimes forms a fourth or a fifth layer of
leaves, taking care to bend the leaves at the narrow extremity
or closed end of the cell, so as to bring them into a convex
shape.</p>

<p>When she has in this manner completed a cell, her next
business is to replenish it with a store of honey and pollen,
which, being chiefly collected from thistles, forms a beautiful
rose-coloured conserve. In this she deposits a single egg,
and then covers in the opening with three pieces of leaf, so
exactly circular, that a pair of compasses could not define
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
their margin with more accuracy. In this manner the
industrious and ingenious upholsterer proceeds till the whole
gallery is filled, the convex extremity of the one fitting into
the open end of the next, and serving both as a basis and as
the means of strengthening it. If, by any accident, the
labour of these insects is interrupted or the edifice deranged,
they exhibit astonishing perseverance in setting it again to
rights. Insects, indeed, are not easily forced to abandon
any work which they may have begun.</p>

<p>The monkish legends tell us that St. Francis Xavier,
walking one day in a garden, and seeing an insect, of the
<i>Mantis</i> genus, moving along in its solemn way, holding up
its two fore legs, as in the act of devotion, desired it to sing
the praises of God. The legend adds that the saint immediately
heard the insect carol a fine canticle with a loud
emphasis. We want no miraculous voice to record the
wonders of the Almighty hand, when we regard the insect
world. The little rose-leaf cutter, pursuing her work with
the nicest mathematical art&mdash;using no artificial instruments
to form her ovals and her circles&mdash;knowing that the elastic
property of the leaves will retain them in their position&mdash;making
her nest of equal strength throughout, by the most
rational adjustment of each distinct part&mdash;demands from us
something more than mere wonder; for such an exercise of
instinctive ingenuity at once directs our admiration to the
great Contriver, who has so admirably proportioned her
knowledge to her necessities.</p>

<p class="caption2">CARDER-BEES; HUMBLE-BEES; SOCIAL-WASPS.</p>


<p>The bees and wasps, whose ingenious architecture we have
already examined, are solitary in their labours. Those
we are about to describe live in society. The perfection of
the social state among this class of insects is certainly that
of the hive-bees. They are the inhabitants of a large city,
where the arts are carried to a higher excellence than in
small districts enjoying little communication of intelligence.
But the bees of the villages, if we may follow up the parallel,
are not without their interest. Such are those which are
called carder-bees and humble-bees.</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Carder-Bees.</p>

<p>The nests of the bees which Réaumur denominates carders
(<i>Bombus muscorum</i>, <span class="smcap">Latr.</span>) are by no means uncommon, and
are well worth the study of the naturalist. During the hay
harvest, they are frequently met with by mowers in the
open fields and meadows; but they may sometimes be discovered
in hedge-banks, the borders of copses, or among
moss-grown stones. The description of the mode of building
adopted by this bee has been copied by most of our
writers on insects from Réaumur; though he is not a little
severe on those who write without having ever had a single
nest in their possession. We have been able to avoid such a
reproach; for we have now before us a very complete nest
of carder-bees, which differs from those described by Réaumur,
in being made not of moss, but withered grass. With
this exception, we find that his account agrees accurately
with our own observations. (J. R.)</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 382px;">
<img src="images/075.png" width="382" height="448" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. A represents two Carder-Bees heckling moss for their Nests;
B, exterior view of the Nest of the Carder-Bee.</div>
</div>

<p>The carder-bees select for their nest a shallow excavation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
about half a foot in diameter; but when they cannot
find one to suit their purpose, they undertake the Herculean
task of digging one themselves. They cover this hollow
with a dome of moss&mdash;sometimes, as we have ascertained,
of withered grass. They make use, indeed, of whatever
materials may be within their reach; for they do not attempt
to bring anything from a distance, not even when they are
deprived of the greater portion by an experimental naturalist.
Their only method of transporting materials to the building
is by pushing them along the ground&mdash;the bee, for that
purpose, working backwards, with its head turned from the
nest. If there is only one bee engaged in this labour, as
usually happens in the early spring, when a nest is founded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
by a solitary female who has outlived the winter, she transports
her little bundles of moss or grass by successive backward
pushes, till she gets them home.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the season, when the hive is populous
and can afford more hands, there is an ingenious division of
this labour. A file of bees, to the number sometimes of
half a dozen, is established, from the nest to the moss or
grass which they intend to use, the heads of all the file of
bees being turned from the nest and towards the material.
The last bee of the file lays hold of some of the moss with
her mandibles, disentangles it from the rest, and having
<i>carded</i> it with her fore legs into a sort of felt or small
bundle, she pushes it under her body to the next bee, who
passes it in the same manner to the next, and so on till it
is brought to the border of the nest,&mdash;in the same way as
we sometimes see sugar-loaves conveyed from a cart to a
warehouse, by a file of porters throwing them from one to
another.</p>

<p>The elevation of the dome, which is all built from the
interior, is from four to six inches above the level of the
field. Beside the moss or grass, they frequently employ
coarse wax to form the ceiling of the vault, for the purpose
of keeping out rain, and preventing high winds from destroying
it. Before this finishing is given to the nest, we have
remarked, that on a fine sunshiny day the upper portion of
the dome was opened to the extent of more than an inch, in
order, we suppose, to forward the hatching of the eggs in the
interior; but on the approach of night this was carefully
covered in again. It was remarkable that the opening which
we have just mentioned was never used by the bees for either
their entrance or their exit from the nest, though they were
all at work there, and, of course, would have found it the
readiest and easiest passage; but they invariably made their
exit and their entrance through the covert-way or gallery
which opens at the bottom of the nest, and, in some nests, is
about a foot long and half an inch wide. This is, no doubt,
intended for concealment from field-mice, polecats, wasps, and
other depredators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>On removing a portion of the dome and bringing the
interior of the structure into view, we find little of the
architectural regularity so conspicuous in the combs of a
common bee-hive: instead of this symmetry, there are only a
few egg-shaped, dark-coloured cells, placed somewhat irregularly,
but approaching more to the horizontal than to the
vertical position, and connected together with small amorphous<a name="FNanchor_T" id="FNanchor_T"></a><a href="#Footnote_T" class="fnanchor">[T]</a>
columns of brown wax. Sometimes there are two or
three of these oval cells placed one above another, without
anything to unite them.</p>

<p>These cells are not, however, the workmanship of the
old bees, but of their young grubs, who spin them when
they are about to change into nymphs. But, from these
cases, when they are spun, the enclosed insects have no
means of escaping, and they depend for their liberation
on the old bees gnawing off the covering, as is done also
by ants in the same circumstances. The instinct with
which they know the precise time when it is proper to
do this is truly wonderful. It is no less so, that these
cocoons are by no means useless when thus untenanted,
for they subsequently serve for honey-pots, and are indeed
the only store-cells in the nest. For this purpose the edge
of the cell is repaired and strengthened with a ring of wax.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 296px;">
<img src="images/077.png" width="296" height="159" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Breeding-Cells.</div>
</div>

<p>The true breeding-cells are contained in several amorphous
masses of brown-coloured wax, varying in dimensions,
but of a somewhat flat and globular shape. On opening any
of these, a number of eggs or grubs are found, on whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
account the mother bee has collected the masses of wax,
which also contain a supply of pollen moistened with honey,
for their subsistence.</p>

<p>The number of eggs or grubs found in one spheroid of
wax varies from three to thirty, and the bees in a whole nest
seldom exceed sixty. There are three sizes of bees, of which
the females are the largest; but neither these nor the males
are, as in the case of the hive-bee, exempt from labour, the
females, indeed, always found the nests, since they alone
survive the winter, all the rest perishing with cold. In
each nest, also, are several females, that live in harmony
together.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Interior views of Carder-Bee&rsquo;s Nest.</div>
</div>

<p>The carder-bees may be easily distinguished from their
congeners (of the same genus), by being not unlike the
colour of the withered moss with which they build their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
nests, having the fore part of their back a dull orange, and
hinder part ringed with different shades of greyish yellow.
They are not so large as the common humble-bee (<i>Bombus
terrestris</i>, <span class="smcap">Latr.</span>), but rather shorter and thicker in the body
than the common hive-bee (<i>Apis mellifica</i>).</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Lapidary-Bees.</p>

<p>A bee still more common, perhaps, than the carder is the
orange-tailed bee, or lapidary (<i>Bombus lapidaria</i>), readily
known by its general black colour and reddish orange tail.
It builds its nest sometimes in stony ground, but prefers a
heap of stones such as are gathered off grass fields or are
piled up near quarries. Unlike the carder, the lapidary
carries to its nest bits of moss, which are very neatly
arranged into a regular oval. These insects associate in
their labours; and they make honey with great industry.
The individuals of a nest are more numerous than the
carders, and likewise more pertinaciously vindictive. About
two years ago we discovered a nest of these bees at Compton-Bassett,
in Wiltshire, in the centre of a heap of limestone
rubbish; but owing to the brisk defensive warfare of their
legionaries, we could not obtain a view of the interior. It
was not even safe to approach within many yards of the
place; and we do not exaggerate when we say that several of
them pursued us most pertinaciously about a quarter of a
mile. (J. R.)</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Humble-Bees.</p>

<p>The common humble-bee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>) is precisely
similar in its economy to the two preceding species, with this
difference, that it forms its nest underground like the common
wasp, in an excavated chamber, to which a winding passage
leads, of from one to two feet, and of a diameter sufficient to
allow of two bees passing. The cells have no covering beside
the vault of the excavation and patches of coarse wax similar
to that of the carder-bee.</p>

<p>[The accompanying illustration represents a group of cells
made by this species. As may be seen by reference to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
engraving, they are not placed with any regularity, but seem
to be tossed about at random.</p>

</div>

<p>Some of the cells contain larvæ, in others, those closely
sealed, lie the pupæ in different stages of development, and
some of the cells are filled with a very fragrant and sweet
honey, which, however, is injurious to many persons, giving
them severe and persistent headaches, even though taken in
small quantities.]</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Social-Wasps.</p>

<p>The nest of the common wasp (<i>Vespa vulgaris</i>) attracts
more or less the attention of everybody; but its interior
architecture is not so well known as it deserves to be, for
its singular ingenuity, in which it rivals even that of the
hive-bee (<i>Apis mellifica</i>). In their general economy the
social or republican wasps closely resemble the humble-bee
(<i>Bombus</i>), every colony being founded by a single
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
female who has survived the winter, to the rigours of which
all her summer associates of males and working wasps
uniformly fall victims. Nay, out of three hundred females
which may be found in one vespiary, or wasp&rsquo;s nest, towards
the close of autumn, scarcely ten or a dozen survive till
the ensuing spring, at which season they awake from their
hibernal lethargy, and begin with ardour the labours of
colonization.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to follow one of these mother wasps
through her several operations, in which she merits more the
praise of industry than the queen of a bee-hive, who does
nothing, and never moves without a numerous train of
obedient retainers, always ready to execute her commands
and to do her homage. The mother wasp, on the contrary,
is at first alone, and is obliged to perform every species of
drudgery herself.</p>

<p>Her first care, after being roused to activity by the returning
warmth of the season, is to discover a place suitable for
her intended colony; and, accordingly, in the spring, wasps
may be seen prying into every hole of a hedge-bank, particularly
where field-mice have burrowed. Some authors
report that she is partial to the forsaken galleries of the
mole; but this does not accord with our observations, as we
have never met with a single vespiary in any situation
likely to have been frequented by moles. But though we
cannot assert the fact, we think it highly probable that the
deserted nest of the field-mouse, which is not uncommon in
hedge-banks, may be sometimes appropriated by a mother
wasp as an excavation convenient for her purpose. Yet,
if she does make choice of the burrow of a field-mouse, it
requires to be afterwards considerably enlarged in the
interior chamber, and the entrance gallery very much
narrowed.</p>

<p>The desire of the wasp to save herself the labour of
excavation, by forming her nest where other animals have
burrowed, is not without a parallel in the actions of quadrupeds,
and even of birds. In the splendid continuation of
Wilson&rsquo;s American Ornithology, by Charles L. Bonaparte
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
(whose scientific pursuits have thrown around that name a
beneficent lustre, pleasingly contrasted with his uncle&rsquo;s
glory), there is an interesting example of this instinctive
adoption of the labours of others. "In the trans-Mississippian
territories of the United States, the burrowing-owl
resides exclusively in the villages of the marmot, or prairie-dog,
whose excavations are so commodious as to render it
unnecessary that the owl should dig for himself, as he is
said to do where no burrowing animals exist.<a name="FNanchor_U" id="FNanchor_U"></a><a href="#Footnote_U" class="fnanchor">[U]</a> The villages
of the prairie-dog are very numerous and variable in their
extent,&mdash;sometimes covering only a few acres, and at others
spreading over the surface of the country for miles together.
They are composed of slightly-elevated mounds, having the
form of a truncated cone, about two feet in width at the
base, and seldom rising as high as eighteen inches from the
surface of the soil. The entrance is placed either at the
top or on the side, and the whole mound is beaten down
externally, especially at the summit, resembling a much-used
footpath. From the entrance, the passage into the
mound descends vertically for one or two feet, and is thence
continued obliquely downwards until it terminates in an
apartment, within which the industrious prairie-dog constructs,
on the approach of cold weather, a comfortable cell
for his winter&rsquo;s sleep. The cell, which is composed of fine
dry grass, is globular in form, with an opening at top,
capable of admitting the finger; and the whole is so firmly
compacted, that it might without injury be rolled over the
floor."<a name="FNanchor_V" id="FNanchor_V"></a><a href="#Footnote_V" class="fnanchor">[V]</a></p>

<p>In case of need the wasp is abundantly furnished by
nature with instruments for excavating a burrow out of
the solid ground, as she no doubt most commonly does&mdash;digging
the earth with her strong mandibles, and carrying
it off or pushing it out as she proceeds. The entrance
gallery is about an inch or less in diameter, and usually
runs in a winding or zig-zag direction, from one to two feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
in depth. In the chamber to which this gallery leads, and
which, when completed, is from one to two feet in diameter,
the mother wasp lays the foundations of her city, beginning
with the walls.</p>

<p>The building materials employed by wasps were long a
matter of conjecture to scientific inquirers; for the bluish-grey
papery substance of the whole structure has no resemblance
to any sort of wax employed by bees for a similar
purpose. Now that the discovery has been made, we can
with difficulty bring ourselves to believe that a naturalist
so acute and indefatigable as M. Réaumur, should have, for
twenty years, as he tells us, endeavoured, without success,
to find out the secret. At length, however, his perseverance
was rewarded. He remarked a female wasp alight on the
sash of his window, and begin to gnaw the wood with her
mandibles; and it struck him at once that she was procuring
materials for building. He saw her detach from the
wood a bundle of fibres about a tenth of an inch in length,
and finer than a hair; and as she did not swallow these,
but gathered them into a mass with her feet, he could not
doubt that his first idea was correct. In a short time she
shifted to another part of the window-frame, carrying with
her the fibres she had collected, and to which she continued
to add, when he caught her, in order to examine the nature
of her bundle; and he found that it was not yet moistened
nor rolled into a ball, as is always done before employing it
in building. In every other respect it had precisely the
same colour and fibrous texture as the walls of a vespiary.
It struck him as remarkable that it bore no resemblance to
wood gnawed by other insects, such as the goat-moth caterpillar,
which is granular like sawdust. This would not
have suited the design of the wasp, who was well aware
that fibres of some length form a stronger texture. He
even discovered, that before detaching the fibres, she
bruised them (<i>les charpissoit</i>) into a sort of lint (<i>charpie</i>) with
her mandibles. All this the careful naturalist imitated by
bruising and paring the same wood of the window-sash with
his penknife, till he succeeded in making a little bundle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
fibres scarcely to be distinguished from that collected by
the wasp.</p>

<p>We have ourselves frequently seen wasps employed in
procuring their materials in this manner, and have always
observed that they shift from one part to another more than
once in preparing a single load&mdash;a circumstance which we
ascribe entirely to the restless temper peculiar to the whole
order of hymenopterous insects. Réaumur found that the
wood which they preferred was such as had been long exposed
to the weather, and is old and dry. White of Selborne,
and Kirby and Spence, on the contrary, maintain
that wasps obtain their paper from sound timber, hornets
only from that which is decayed.<a name="FNanchor_W" id="FNanchor_W"></a><a href="#Footnote_W" class="fnanchor">[W]</a> Our own observations,
however, confirm the statement of Réaumur with respect
to wasps, as, in every instance which has fallen under our
notice, the wood selected was very much weathered; and
in one case, an old oak post in a garden at Lee, in Kent,
half destroyed by dry-rot, was seemingly the resort of all
the wasps in the vicinity. In another case, the deal bond
in a brick wall, which had been built thirty years, is at this
moment (June, 1829) literally striped with the gnawings
of wasps, which we have watched at the work for hours
together. (J. R.)</p>

<p>[Different species of wasps use different materials for their
nest. <i>Vespa vulgaris</i> always uses decayed wood, while <i>V.
germanica</i> and other species use sound wood. Owing to the
colour, the distinction between the nests of these insects is
evident at a glance.</p>

<p>The bundles of ligneous fibres thus detached are moistened
before being used, with a glutinous liquid, which causes them
to adhere together, and are then kneaded into a sort of paste,
or <i>papier maché</i>.</p>

<p>The method employed by the wasp in making its nest has
been so admirably described by Mr. S. Stone, that we cannot
do better than copy his description, which appeared in
&ldquo;Beeton&rsquo;s Annual&rdquo; of 1865.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Having found a place suitable&mdash;the deserted burrows of
the field-mice being perhaps more generally selected than
any other by the underground species, the chamber formed by
that animal for its nest being exactly the kind of place required
by the insect&mdash;it proceeds to attach its web to the
centre of the roof of the chamber. This consists, in the first
instance, of a pedicle, or footstalk, about half an inch in
length, at the extremity of which a single cell is formed,
which is presently surrounded by others.</p>

<p>"Simultaneously with the formation of these cells, an umbrella-shaped
covering is prepared above them. More cells
are added, an egg being deposited in each of them as soon as
formed, while constant additions are made to the covering
until it has assumed a globular form, with only an aperture
sufficiently large for the insect to pass in and out. Before
the completion of the first covering, a second, just large
enough to enclose it, is begun, and while this is in progress a
third is commenced, and then a fourth, and so on. When
young wasps have been produced in sufficient numbers to
carry on the work without the assistance of the parent, an
event which usually takes place in about six weeks from the
commencement of the nest, she does not again leave home, but
occupies herself solely in the task of depositing eggs as fast
as cells can be formed by the workers for their reception.</p>

<p>"There are two methods by which the nests are enlarged
by the workers after the queen has given up the task of
building; some species choosing one, some adopting the other.
One consists in forming a series of regular sheets or layers,
which are made to overlap each other like the slates or tiles
on the roof of a building, in the same way as is pursued by
the queen of every species so long as she continues to be
the architect. When a few of these sheets have been completed,
that is, when they have been made to assume a
spherical form, with only a small aperture for ingress and
egress, each internal sheet is cut away, nearly but not quite,
as fast as additional ones are formed externally, the shell or
covering therefore slightly increasing in thickness as the
nest increases in size. Thus architects among the human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
race are careful to proportion the thickness, and consequently
the strength of the walls to the magnitude of the building
designed to be erected.</p>

<p>"The other method consists in forming hollow pieces, or
raising, as it were, blisters all over the plain surface which
the queen has left; and upon these other blisters, and so on
continually; cutting away, as in the former case, the under
skin on the formation of the outer one. The latter method
is adopted by the workers of <i>V. crabro</i>, <i>V. vulgaris</i>, and <i>V.
germanica</i>; the former by <i>V. Norvegica</i>, <i>V. sylvestris</i>, <i>V.
rufa</i>, and probably by <i>V. arborea</i>. Cutting away the inner
portions of the coverings is a necessary process in order to
make room for the increased size of the comb or combs. The
material cut away is not thrown by as useless, but is worked
up afresh; indeed this is effected in, and by, the very act of
removing it; it is then either used in enlarging the combs or
it is brought out and employed in making additions to the
outside.</p>

<p>"As the nest increases in size, it is obvious that the cavity
in which it is placed must be proportionably enlarged; accordingly,
each wasp, as it emerges from the aperture, may
be observed to bring out with it a small lump of earth which
it has scraped from the walls of the chamber, care being
taken to keep a clear space of about a quarter of an inch
between the covering of the nest, and the walls of the
chamber. About the same space also occurs between the
combs, which are placed horizontally, with the mouth of the
cells downwards; supporting columns or pillars being constructed
at regular intervals so as to keep them at a proper
distance apart, thus allowing the insects room to pass
between them for the purpose of feeding the grubs. Supporting
columns or pillars are also placed between the roof of
the chamber and the crown of the nest, connecting the one
with the other; and these supports are constantly strengthened
as the increasing weight of the nest renders such a
precaution necessary.</p>

<p>"The material of which the wasps&rsquo; nests are composed is a
sort of paper manufactured chiefly from wood by the insects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
themselves; one species using sound wood for the purpose,
another that which has become decayed. This they
scrape by means of their jaws from posts, rails, gates, hurdles,
&amp;c., in which act it becomes mixed with some peculiar fluid
with which they are provided; it then possesses nearly the
same properties as the pulp from which paper is made, but is
of firmer consistence. This is gathered in a small lump
under the chest, to which it adheres, and in that way is
carried to the nest.</p>

<p>"The operators having, after the exhibition of a considerable
amount of fickleness in the choice, fixed upon a suitable place
for commencing, or recommencing operations&mdash;for these remarks
have reference to a nest already somewhat advanced
in the building&mdash;place themselves along the edge of a yet
unfinished piece, then walking slowly backward, spread the
material as they go, along this edge, where it forms a thick
streak; they then go forward to the point at which they
began to spread the composition, again marching slowly
backward, press this streak between their jaws, which acts as
a pair of pincers, thus thinning it out throughout its whole
length. They then go forward a second time, pressing it
still thinner, and then a third, and so on, until they have
rendered it sufficiently thin. Before this is accomplished,
the operators have generally to go five or six times over their
work. They do not return to the same spot with their next
burden, but seek a fresh one, and thus allow the work they
recently executed to become dry and firm, previous to making
further additions to it. Possibly the material first &lsquo;used
up&rsquo; was from wood of a dark colour; the next may be from
light-coloured wood, and the next from that of an intermediate
colour; and this it is which gives so much beauty to
the coverings of the nests of these insects.</p>

<p>"<i>Vespa crabro</i> and <i>V. vulgaris</i> are the only species which use
decayed wood or touchwood in the fabrication of their nests;
the other species employ sound wood, varied occasionally
by sound vegetable fibre obtained from plants of different
kinds.</p>

<p>"From the upper combs in a nest, workers are produced;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
from the lower ones, queens or females; and from the intermediate
ones, males. Workers become developed early in
the season, males not till an advanced period; and young
females or queens not until towards the close of the season.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The nests of <i>V. crabro</i>, <i>V. vulgaris</i>, and <i>V. germanica</i>,
when of full size, measure not unfrequently twelve inches in
diameter, the communities working on, in a favourable season,
until the month of November; while the labours of the
other species close, and the communities break up towards
the end of August; their nests scarcely attaining to half the
size of those above mentioned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The accompanying illustration exhibits the nest of the
common wasp in an early stage. The first cover has been
completed, and a second is in course of progress. We have
now before us a beautiful series of wasps&rsquo; nests, in their
various stages, prepared by Mr. Stone, in order to show the
progressive enlargement of the edifice.</p>

<img src="images/088.png" width="199" height="189" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Nest of Wasp in an early stage.</div>
</div>

<p>First, there is the single cell attached to a small part that
had penetrated the roof of the burrow. Next comes a more
advanced stage, in which three cells are made, and the roof
is just begun, being not quite half an inch in diameter.
Then come five cells, and a tolerably large roof; and then
twelve cells, with a complete roof.</p>

<p>The next stage is that which is represented in the illustration,
where the group of cells is seen suspended from its
slender footstalk, and a second covering is in progress. By
degrees the nest enlarges until the second layer or tier of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
cells is begun, while the first tier is occupied in the centre
by the pupæ, sheltered by their little silk doors, and on the
circumference by the larvæ, whose cells are still open in
order to allow themselves to be fed by the nurse-wasps.</p>

<img src="images/089.png" width="160" height="192" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Section of the same Nest, showing the first tier of Cells.</div>
</div>

<p>In these nests, the difference between the homes of <i>Vespa
vulgaris</i> and those of <i>V. germanica</i> is very strongly marked,
the former being yellowish brown, and the latter grey.
One nest of <i>V. germanica</i>, is remarkable for being thickly
studded with the long, white eggs of some insect, probably a
parasite, which has gained admittance to the burrow, in spite
of the care of its guardians. It may be here mentioned, that
<i>V. germanica</i> is by far the most common species of wasp in
England.</p>

<p>The illustration at <a href="#Page_90">p. 90</a> represents a completed nest of
<i>V. germanica</i>. The rough, thick covering is seen outside, and
within are the tiers of cells, each layer being supported by
pillars from the layer immediately above. These pillars are
always formed at the angle where these cells touch each
other, so as to obtain as strong a foundation as possible.
Only a very small space is left between the combs,
just enough room, in fact, for the nurse-wasps to pass as
they feed the young. The reader will remember that
the young wasps all hang with their heads downwards,
being held in their places by a sort of clasper at the end of
the tail.]</p>

<p>When the foundress-wasp has completed a certain number
of cells, and deposited eggs in them, she soon intermits her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
building operations, in order to procure food for the young
grubs, which now require all her care. In a few weeks these
become perfect wasps, and lend their assistance in the
extension of the edifice; enlarging the original coping of the
foundress by side walls, and forming another platform of
cells, suspended to the first by columns, as that had been
suspended to the ceiling.</p>

<i>a a</i>, the external wall; <i>b</i>, <i>c c</i>, five small terraces of cells for the neuter wasps,
<i>d d</i>, <i>e e</i>, three rows of larger cells for the males and females.</div>
</div>

<p>In this manner several platforms of combs are constructed,
the outer walls being extended at the same time; and, by
the end of the summer, there is generally from twelve to
fifteen platforms of cells. Each contains about 1060 cells&mdash;forty-nine
being contained in an inch and a half square, and,
of course, making the enormous number of about 16,000
cells in one colony. Réaumur, upon these data, calculates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
that one vespiary may produce every year more than 30,000
wasps, reckoning only 10,000 cells, and each serving successively
for the cradle of three generations. But, although
the whole structure is built at the expense of so much labour
and ingenuity, it has scarcely been finished before the winter
sets in, when it becomes nearly useless, and serves only for
the abode of a few benumbed females, who abandon it on the
approach of spring, and never return; for wasps do not, like
mason-bees, ever make use of the same nest for more than
one season.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">A, represents one of the rods from which the terraces are suspended. B, a portion of the

</div>

<p>Both Réaumur and the younger Huber studied the proceedings
of the common wasp in the manner which has been
so successful in observing bees&mdash;by means of glazed hives,
and other contrivances. In this, these naturalists were
greatly aided by the extreme affection of wasps for their
young; for though their nest is carried off, or even cut in
various directions, and exposed to the light, they never
desert it, nor relax their attention to their progeny. When
a wasp&rsquo;s nest is removed from its natural situation, and
covered with a glass hive, the first operation of the inhabitants
is to repair the injuries it has suffered. They carry off with
surprising activity all the earth or other matters which have
fallen by accident into the nest; and when they have got it
thoroughly cleared of everything extraneous, they begin to
secure it from further derangement, by fixing it to the glass
with papyraceous columns, similar to those which we have
already described. The breaches which the nest may have
suffered are then repaired, and the thickness of the walls is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
augmented, with the design, perhaps, of more effectually
excluding the light.</p>

<p class="tb_stars">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>The nest of the hornet is nearly the same in structure
with that of the wasp; but the materials are considerably
coarser, and the columns to which the platforms of cells
are suspended are larger and stronger, the middle one being
twice as thick as any of the others. The hornet, also, does
not build underground, but in the cavities of trees, or in the
thatch or under the eaves of barns. Réaumur once found
upon a wall a hornet&rsquo;s nest which had not been long begun,
and had it transferred to the outside of his study-window;
but in consequence, as he imagined, of the absence of the
foundress-hornet at the time it was removed, he could not get
the other five hornets, of which the colony consisted, either
to add to the building or repair the damages which it had
sustained.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 260px;">

<div class="fig_caption">Hornet&rsquo;s Nest in its first stage.</div>
</div>

<p>M. Réaumur differs from our English naturalists, White,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and Kirby and Spence, with respect to the materials employed
by the hornet for building. The latter say that it
employs decayed wood; the former, that it uses the bark of
the ash-tree, but takes less pains to split it into fine fibres
than wasps do; not, however, because it is destitute of skill;
for in constructing the suspensory columns of the platforms,
a paste is prepared little inferior to that made by wasps.
We cannot, from our own observations, decide which of the
above statements is correct, as we have only once seen a
hornet procuring materials, at Compton-Bassett, in Wiltshire;
and in that case it gnawed the inner bark of an elm which
had been felled for several months, and was, consequently,
dry and tough. Such materials as this would account for the
common yellowish-brown colour of a hornet&rsquo;s nest. (J. R.)</p>

<p>[The accompanying figure represents a completed hornet&rsquo;s
nest as it appears when suspended from a beam. Hornets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
often choose for their home the space between the roof and the
ceiling of summer-houses, and the nests that are made in such
localities are mostly large and handsome. The reader should
notice the blisters by means of which the insect enlarges its
habitation.]</p>

<p>When hornets make choice of a tree for their domicile,
they select one which is in a state of decay, and already
partly hollowed; but they possess the means, in their sharp
and strong mandibles, of extending the excavation to suit
their purposes; and Réaumur frequently witnessed their
operations in mining into a decayed tree, and carrying off
what they had gnawed. He observed, also, that in such
cases they did not make use of the large hole of the tree for
an entrance, but went to the trouble of digging a gallery,
sufficient for the passage of the largest hornet in the nest,
through the living and undecayed portion of the tree. As
this is perforated in a winding direction, it is no doubt
intended for the purpose of protecting the nest from the
intrusion of depredators, who could more easily effect an
entrance if there were not such a tortuous way to pass
through.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Hornet&rsquo;s Nest in a hollow tree.</div>
</div>

<p>[Here is an illustration of a hornet&rsquo;s nest as it appears in
the hollow of a tree. Industrious as is this insect, it never
takes needless trouble, and alters its nest according to circumstances.
As has already been seen, the combs are defended
by a complete cover when the nest is placed in an open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
situation. But when it is built in the hollow of a tree there
is no cover at all, the insect evidently knowing that the
wooden wall with which the cells are surrounded, affords a sufficient
protection. In cases where a cover is made, the hornets
do not form only a single entrance, as is the case with the wasp,
but have a large number of small entrances in different parts
of the wall. Some of these entrances can be seen in the

<p>Hornets are in one sense more industrious than wasps.
When night falls, the wasps betake themselves to their home,
and sleep throughout the night. But, if the moon be up, the
hornet is sure to work throughout the entire night, and will
often do so, even when no moon is visible.]</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable of our native social wasps is
the tree-wasp (<i>Vespa Britannica</i>), which is not uncommon
in the northern, but is seldom to be met with in the southern
parts of the island. Instead of burrowing in the ground like
the common wasp (<i>Vespa vulgaris</i>), or in the hollows of trees
like the hornet (<i>Vespa crabro</i>), it boldly swings its nest from
the extremity of a branch, where it exhibits some resemblance,
in size and colour, to a Welsh wig hung out to dry. We
have seen more than one of these nests on the same tree, at
Catrine, in Ayrshire, and at Wemyss Bay, in Renfrewshire.
The tree which the Britannic wasp prefers is the silver fir,
whose broad flat branch serves as a protection to the suspended
nest both from the sun and the rain. We have also
known a wasp&rsquo;s nest of this kind in a gooseberry-bush, at
Red-house Castle, East Lothian. The materials and structure
are nearly the same as those employed by the common wasp,
and which we have already described. (J. R.)</p>

<p>[We have before us a beautiful example of a nest made by
this species of wasp. There are no less than three consecutive
coverings quite entire, while another is about three-fourths
completed, and a fifth is just begun. The illustration
exhibits a very perfect specimen.]</p>

<p>A singular nest of a species of wasp is figured by Réaumur,
but is apparently rare in this country, as Kirby and Spence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
mention only a single nest of similar construction, found in
a garden at East-Dale. This nest is of a flattened globular
figure, and composed of a great number of envelopes, so as
to assume a considerable resemblance to a half-expanded
Provence rose. The British specimen mentioned by Kirby and
Spence had only one platform of cells; Réaumur had two;
but there was a large vacant space, which would probably
have been filled with cells, had the nest not been taken away
as a specimen. The whole nest was not much larger than a
rose, and was composed of paper exactly similar to that
employed by the common ground-wasp.<a name="FNanchor_X" id="FNanchor_X"></a><a href="#Footnote_X" class="fnanchor">[X]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>[This is probably the nest of <i>V. rufa</i>. We possess several
specimens of the nest, one of which corresponds tolerably
closely with the edifice described in the work.]</p>

</div>

<p>There is another species of social-wasp (<i>Epipone nidulans</i>,
<span class="smcap">Latr.</span>) meriting attention from the singular construction of
its nest. It forms one or more terraces of cells, similar to
those of the common wasp, but without the protection of an
outer wall, and quite exposed to the weather. Swammerdam
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
found a nest of this description attached to the stem of a
nettle. Réaumur says that they are sometimes attached to
the branch of a thorn or other shrub, or to stalks of grass;&mdash;peculiarities
which prove that there are several species of
these wasps.</p>

<img src="images/098.png" width="297" height="348" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Wasps&rsquo; Cells attached to a Branch.</div>
</div>

<p>The most remarkable circumstance in the architecture
of this species of vespiary is, that it is not horizontal, like
those formerly described, but nearly vertical. The reason
appears to be, that if it had been horizontal, the cells must
have been frequently filled with rain; whereas, in the position
in which it is placed, the rain runs off without lodging. It
is, besides, invariably placed so as to face the north or the
east, and consequently is less exposed to rains, which most
frequently come with southerly or westerly winds. It is
another remarkable peculiarity, that, unlike the nests of
other wasps, it is covered with a shining coat of varnish, to
prevent moisture from soaking into the texture of the wasp&rsquo;s
paper. The laying on this varnish, indeed, forms a considerable
portion of the labour of the colony, and individuals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
may be seen employed for hours together spreading it on with
their tongues.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Comb of Polistes.</div>
</div>

<p>[There is a genus of foreign hymenoptera, called <i>Polistes</i>,
which is remarkable for the building powers possessed by its
members. The accompanying illustration is taken from a
nest in the British Museum, and is given of the natural size.
The cells are not hexagonal, like those of the <i>Epipone</i>, but are
roundish in form. Those in the centre assume a roughly
hexagonal form by pressure, but those which form the
circumference of the cell-group are nearly round, especially
on their outer sides. The cells are not of uniform width,
but are narrower at the base than at the mouth, thus
causing the group to assume the form which is seen in the
illustration. This curious group of cells was brought from
Bareilly, in the East Indies, and in the same collection there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
are several other specimens, varying considerably both in
shape and size.]</p>

<p>Few circumstances are more striking, with regard to
insects, as Kirby and Spence justly remark, than the great
and incessant labour which maternal affection for their
progeny leads them to undergo. Some of these exertions are
so disproportionate to the size of the insect, that nothing
short of ocular conviction could attribute them to such an
agent. A wild bee, or a wasp, for instance, as we have seen,
will dig a hole in a hard bank of earth some inches deep, and
five or six times its own size, labouring unremittingly at this
arduous task for several days in succession, and scarcely
allowing itself a moment for eating or repose. It will then
occupy as much time in searching for a store of food; and
no sooner is this finished, than it will set about repeating the
process, and, before it dies, will have completed five or six
similar cells, or even more.</p>

<p>We shall have occasion more particularly to dwell upon
the geometrical arrangement of the cells, both of the wasp
and of the social-bee, in our description of those interesting
operations, which have long attracted the notice, and commanded
the admiration of mathematicians and naturalists.
A few observations may here be properly bestowed upon the
<i>material</i> with which the wasp-family construct the interior of
their nests.</p>

<p>The wasp is a paper-maker, and a most perfect and
intelligent one. While mankind were arriving, by slow
degrees, at the art of fabricating this valuable substance, the
wasp was making it before their eyes, by very much the
same process as that by which human hands now manufacture
it with the best aid of chemistry and machinery. While
some nations carved their records on wood, and stone, and
brass, and leaden tablets,&mdash;others, more advanced, wrote with
a style on wax,&mdash;others employed the inner bark of trees, and
others the skins of animals rudely prepared,&mdash;the wasp was
manufacturing a firm and durable paper. Even when the
papyrus was rendered more fit, by a process of art, for the
transmission of ideas in writing, the wasp was a better artisan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
than the Egyptians; for the early attempts at paper-making
were so rude, that the substance produced was almost useless,
from being extremely friable. The paper of the papyrus
was formed of the leaves of the plant, dried, pressed, and
polished; the wasp alone knew how to reduce vegetable
fibres to a pulp, and then unite them by a size or glue,
spreading the substance out into a smooth and delicate leaf.
This is exactly the process of paper-making. It would seem
that the wasp knows, as the modern paper-makers now know,
that the fibres of rags, whether linen or cotton, are not the
only materials that can be used in the formation of paper;
she employs other vegetable matters, converting them into a
proper consistency by her assiduous exertions. In some
respects she is more skilful even than our paper-makers, for
she takes care to retain her fibres of sufficient length, by
which she renders her paper as strong as she requires. Many
manufacturers of the present day cut their material into small
bits, and thus produce a rotten article. One great distinction
between good and bad paper is its toughness; and this
difference is invariably produced by the fibre of which it is
composed being long, and therefore tough; or short, and
therefore friable.</p>

<p>The wasp has been labouring at her manufacture of paper
from her first creation, with precisely the same instruments
and the same materials; and her success has been unvarying.
Her machinery is very simple, and therefore it is never out
of order. She learns nothing, and she forgets nothing.
Men, from time to time, lose their excellence in particular
arts, and they are slow in finding out real improvements.
Such improvements are often the effect of accident. Paper is
now manufactured very extensively by machinery in all its
stages; and thus, instead of a single sheet being made by
hand, a stream of paper is poured out, which would form a
roll large enough to extend round the globe, if such a length
were desirable. The inventors of this machinery, Messrs.
Fourdrinier, it is said, spent the enormous sum of 40,000<i>l.</i>.
in vain attempts to render the machine capable of determining
with precision the width of the roll; and, at last, accomplished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
their object, at the suggestion of a bystander, by a
strap revolving upon an axis, at a cost of three shillings and
sixpence. Such is the difference between the workings of
human knowledge and experience, and those of animal instinct.
We proceed slowly and in the dark, but our course is not
bounded by a narrow line, for it seems difficult to say what
is the perfection of any art; animals go clearly to a given
point&mdash;but they can go no further. We may, however, learn
something from their perfect knowledge of what is within
their range. It is not improbable that if man had attended
in an earlier state of society to the labours of wasps, he
would have sooner known how to make paper. We are still
behind in our arts and sciences, because we have not always
been observers. If we had watched the operations of insects,
and the structure of insects in general, with more care, we
might have been far advanced in the knowledge of many arts
which are yet in their infancy, for nature has given us
abundance of patterns. We have learnt to perfect some
instruments of sound by examining the structure of the
human ear; and the mechanism of an eye has suggested
some valuable improvements in achromatic glasses.</p>

<p>Réaumur has given a very interesting account of the wasps
of Cayenne (<i>Chartergus nidulans</i>), which hang their nests in
trees.<a name="FNanchor_Y" id="FNanchor_Y"></a><a href="#Footnote_Y" class="fnanchor">[Y]</a> Like the bird of Africa called the social grosbeak
(<i>Loxia socia</i>), they fabricate a perfect house, capable of containing
many hundreds of their community, and suspend it
on high out of the reach of attack. But the Cayenne wasp
is a more expert artist than the bird. He is a pasteboard-maker;&mdash;and
the card with which he forms the exterior
covering of his abode is so smooth, so strong, so uniform in
its texture, and so white, that the most skilful manufacturer
of this substance might be proud of the work. It takes ink
admirably.</p>

<p>The nest of the pasteboard-making wasp is impervious to
water. It hangs upon the branch of a tree, as represented
in the engraving; and those rain-drops which penetrate
through the leaves never rest upon its hard and polished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
surface. A small opening for the entrance of the insects
terminates its funnel-shaped bottom. It is impossible to
unite more perfectly the qualities of lightness and strength.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 330px;">

<div class="fig_caption">Nest of the Pasteboard-maker Wasp, with part removed to show the arrangement
of the Cells.</div>
</div>

<p>In the specimen from which we take our description, the
length of which is nine inches, six stout circular platforms
stretch internally across, like so many floors, and fixed all
round to the walls of the nest. They are smooth above,
with hexagonal cells on the under surface. These platforms
are not quite flat, but rather concave above, like a
watch-glass reversed; the centre of each platform is perforated
for the admission of the wasps, at the extremity of
a short funnel-like projection, and through this access is
gained from story to story. On each platform, therefore,
can the wasps walk leisurely about attending to the pupæ
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
secured in the cells, which, with the mouths downward, cover
the ceiling above their heads&mdash;the height of the latter being
just convenient for their work.</p>

<p>[Unlike the habitations made by the British wasps, and
which are vacated annually, this nest is permanent, and
serves for several successive seasons. Of course, it must
be enlarged continually, so as to accommodate an ever-increasing
number of inhabitants. The mode of enlarging
is sufficiently curious. The British wasps enlarge their
nests either by making a larger covering and then removing
the smaller, or by raising blisters on the outside, and eating
away beneath them. But the pendulous wasp of Brazil proceeds
on just the opposite principle, making new cells first,
and covering them afterwards. The new tier of cells is set
on the bottom of the nest, which thus becomes the floor
of that tier, and a new bottom is then made beneath these
new cells.]</p>

<p>Pendent wasps&rsquo; nests of enormous size are found in Ceylon,
suspended often in the talipot-tree at the height of seventy
feet. The appearance of these nests thus elevated, with the
larger leaves of the tree, used by the natives as umbrellas
and tents, waving over them, is very singular. Though no
species of European wasp is a storer of honey, yet this rule
does not apply to certain species of South America. In the
&lsquo;Annals and Magazine of Natural History&rsquo; for June, 1841,
will be found a detailed account, with a figure, of the pendent
nest of a species termed by Mr. A. White <i>Myrapetra scutellaris</i>.
The external case consists of stout cardboard covered
with conical knobs of various sizes. The entrances are
artfully protected by pent-roofs from the weather and heavy
rains; and are tortuous, so as to render the ingress of a
moth or other large insect difficult. Internally are fourteen
combs, exclusive of a globular mass, the nucleus of several
circular combs, which are succeeded by others of an arched
form&mdash;that is, constituting segments of circles. Many of
the uppermost combs were found to have the cells filled
with honey of a brownish-red colour, but which had lost its
flavour. After entering into some minute details, Mr. A.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
White makes the following interesting observations:&mdash;"Azara,
in the account of his residence in various parts
of South America, mentions the fact of <i>several wasps</i> of these
countries collecting honey. The Baron Walchenaer, who
edited the French translation of this work, published in
1809, thought that the Spanish traveller, who was unskilled
in entomology, had made some mistake with regard to the
insects, and regarded the so-called <i>wasps</i> as belonging to
some <i>bee</i> of the genus of which <i>Apis amalthea</i> is the type
(<i>Melipona</i>). Latreille (who afterwards corrected his mistake)
also believed that they must be referred to the genera
<i>Melipona</i> or <i>Trigona</i>&mdash;insects which in South America take
the place of our honey-bee. These authors were afterwards
clearly convinced of the correctness of Azara&rsquo;s observations,
by the circumstance of M. Auguste de St. Hilaire finding
near the river Uruguay an oval grey-coloured nest of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
papery consistence, like that of the European wasps, suspended
from the branches of a small shrub about a foot from
the ground: he and two other attendants partook of some
honey (contained in its cells) and found it of an agreeable
sweetness, free from the pharmaceutic taste which so frequently
accompanies European honey. He gives a detailed
account of its poisonous effects on himself and his two men.
Afterwards he procured specimens of the wasp, which was described
by Latreille under the name of <i>Polistes Lecheguana</i>."</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Nest of Myrapetra.</div>
</div>

<p>[The accompanying illustration shows this remarkable nest,
both as it appears externally, and when divided vertically.</p>

<p>The material is probably the dung of the Capincha, an
animal allied to the guinea-pig and the agouti. The natives,
at all events, state that such is the case, and the aspect of
the nest as seen through a magnifying glass carries out this
assertion. The nest is hung to a branch, and is seldom more
than four feet from the ground. The insect is a very little
one in comparison with the size of the nest, which is sixteen
inches in length, and twelve in width. The largest specimens
of this insect are only one third of an inch long, while
the generality scarcely exceed a quarter of an inch. Its
colour is brown.</p>

<p>In the section is shown the very peculiar shape of the
combs. At the upper part is seen the globular centre, surrounded
with a comb that completely encircles it. Other
combs follow in order, but are less curved as they approach
the bottom of the nest. The insects obtain admission to the
several tiers by means of apertures which are left between
the extremities of the comb and the wall of the nest. The
combs are made of the same material as the outer wall, but
are very thin and paper-like. This nest may be seen in the
British Museum.]</p>

<p>It would seem that the nest described by Mr. White
agrees with that of a wasp termed <i>Chiguana</i> by Azara (or
<i>Lecheguana</i>), and is very different to the slight papery nest
of the <i>Polistes Lecheguana</i> of Latreille. We may add that
M. Auguste de St. Hilaire speaks of two species of wasps
remarkable for storing honey in South America; the honey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of one is white, of the other reddish. That the habits of
these honey-wasps must differ considerably from those of
any of our European species we may at once admit; perhaps
in some points of their economy these insects may approach
the bee.</p>

<p>[In the same country as is inhabited by the <i>Myrapetra</i>, and
in much the same localities, is sometimes found the nest of
another honey-making wasp, called <i>Nectarinia analis</i>, a small
and plainly-clad insect. It is hung to the branches of low
trees and underwood, and often includes both twigs and
leaves in its structure. The combs of this insect are greatly
curved, in order to suit the shape of the general covering, but
are not arranged with that beautiful regularity which distinguishes
those of the <i>Myrapetra</i>. A specimen of this nest
may be seen in the British Museum, and as the outer covering
has been partially taken away, the observer will be enabled
to note the general form of the combs and the structure of
the cells.</p>

<p>In the accompanying illustration are shown the habitations
of two remarkable insects, both belonging to the <i>Hymenoptera</i>.
Indeed, the greater number of pensile nests made by insects
are formed by members of this important order; and, if we
were to exclude all the wasps, bees, and ants, we should find
that we had excluded about ninety per cent. of the pensile
architects.</p>

<p>The left-hand figure represents a nest made by a species
of <i>Polybia</i>, inhabiting Brazil. It is made of a papery kind
of substance, of rather slight texture, and is fixed to the stalk
of a reed. The outside of the nest is seen to be marked
with a series of horizontal ribs. These show the progressive
stages of the nest, each rib marking a layer of paper as it was
spread by the insect builder. The combs extend throughout
the entire nest, the largest occupying the centre, and the
smallest the ends. Each comb is firmly supported by a footstalk,
which is fixed, not to the upper tier of cells, as is the
case with the British wasps, but to the reed on which the nest
is built.</p>

<p>Other species of <i>Polybia</i> build nests different in shape and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
arrangement, though still of the pensile character. One
species builds a nearly globular nest, made in a rather curious
manner. Carrying out still farther the principle on which
the cardboard wasp enlarges its nest, the <i>Polybia</i> entirely
covers the outer wall with cells, and then makes a new wall
over them. When a nest has reached a tolerable size, it is
composed of a whole series of concentric combs, the roof of
each having been originally the outer wall of the nest.
There are in the British Museum some admirable specimens
of these nests, in some of which the process of enlargement
can be very clearly traced. Patches of new cells are seen upon
the external covering, while a few breaches in the structure
show the concentric combs.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Nests of Polybia.</div>
</div>

<p>One very curious point about these cells is, that they are
not uniform in their direction, as is generally the case with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
those of social hymenoptera. The greater part, such as the
various wasps, hornets, and their kin, have the mouths of the
cells downwards, while the cells of the hive-bee are nearly
horizontal. But the cells of this insect are arranged without
the least regard to their position, all the bases pointing
towards the centre of the nest, and all the mouths radiating
outwards.</p>

<img src="images/109.png" width="495" height="444" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Nests of Synæca and Polybia.</div>
</div>

<p>There seems to be scarcely any bound to the variety
which exists in the nests of the social hymenoptera. The
insect which makes the nest which is represented in the
illustration is a native of Brazil, and is known to entomologists
as <i>Synæca cyanea</i>. The first of these names is given
to it on account of its social habits, and the second, in
reference to the bluish colour of its body. It is rather
larger than the preceding insects, being about three quarters
of an inch in length. Its wings are brown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>The shape and size of the nest are exceedingly variable,
but it is almost invariably longer than wide, and is fixed to a
branch or some similar object. Sometimes it attains considerable
dimensions, and has been known to measure a full
yard in length. Yet, however large it may be, there is only
a single comb, which is set upon the side of the nest next the
branch, and, in consequence, has almost all its cells placed in
a horizontal direction. In the illustration, the right-hand
figure represents the external appearance of the nest, and the
central figure shows the manner in which the single comb is
set upon the branch. The nest which occupies the left hand
of the illustration is made by a species of <i>Polybia</i>, and is here
given in order to show a remarkable example of similarity in
the mode of building adopted by two different insects. In
the one case, however, the cells are all fastened by their bases
to the branch, but in the other the cells are attached to one
common base which is prolonged into a footstalk.</p>

<p>There have been lately discovered some very remarkable
social nests. Specimens of both these nests may be seen in
the entomological department of the museum at Oxford.</p>

<p>The first is formed very much like a rather flattened
Florence flask, and is hung by the neck from the branch of a
tree. It is made of a strong, parchment-like substance,
formed by innumerable silken threads woven and matted
together into a kind of felt. When it was cut open a most
singular sight was exhibited. Nearly the whole of the
interior was covered with the pupæ of some butterfly, all
hanging by their tails, and many of them suspended to a
twig which projected downwards into the nest. Although
the nest is barely eight inches in length, a great proportion
of which is taken up by the neck, about one hundred pupæ
were found in it. At the bottom of the nest is a small and
nearly circular aperture, through which the insects could
make their way as soon as they escaped from the pupal
envelope, and before their wings became extended and
hardened.</p>

<p>The butterfly which makes this singular nest is a native of
Mexico, and is named <i>Eucheira socialis</i>. The colour of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
wings is dark brown, with an ill-defined white band across
them.</p>

<p>The second nest was brought from tropical Africa, and is
remarkable for another peculiarity. It is shaped much like
a cushion, and its measurements are, eight inches in length,
five and a half in breadth, and three in depth. Instead of
having only one place of exit for the inmates, it has thirteen
or fourteen, all formed in the same manner. A number of short,
stiff, and almost bristly threads are set round the apertures,
their ends all projecting outwards, and converging to a point,
where they all meet and even slightly cross each other.
Owing to this structure, it is easy enough for any of the
insects to pass out, as the converging hairs yield to the
pressure, whereas they form an effectual barrier against any
insect that wishes to creep into the nest.</p>

<p>The material of the nest is very strong and hard, and is
formed of two layers, the inner being made of smooth brown
silk, and the outer of harsher and stronger orange silk
threads.]</p>

<p>Although the hive-bee (<i>Apis mellifica</i>) has engaged the
attention of the curious from the earliest ages, recent
discoveries prove that we are yet only beginning to arrive at
a correct knowledge of its wonderful proceedings. Pliny
informs us that Astromachus, of Soles, in Cilicia, devoted
fifty-eight years to the study; and that Philiscus the
Thracian spent his whole life in forests for the purpose of
observing them. But in consequence (as we may naturally
infer) of the imperfect methods of research, assuming that
what they did discover was known to Aristotle, Columella,
and Pliny, we are justified in pronouncing the statements
of these philosophers, as well as the embellished poetical
pictures of Virgil, to be nothing more than conjecture,
almost in every particular erroneous. It was not indeed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
till 1711, when glass hives were invented by Maraldi, a
mathematician of Nico, that what we may call the in-door
proceedings of bees could be observed. This important
invention was soon afterwards taken advantage of by
M. Réaumur, who laid the foundation of the more recent
discoveries of John Hunter, Schirach, and the Hubers.
The admirable architecture which bees exhibit in their
miniature cities has, by these and other naturalists, been
investigated with great care and accuracy. We shall endeavour
to give as full an account of the wonderful structures
as our limits will allow. In this we shall chiefly follow
M. Huber the elder, whose researches appear almost miraculous
when we consider that he was blind.</p>

<p>At the early age of seventeen this remarkable man lost
his sight by <i>gutta serena</i>, the &ldquo;drop serene&rdquo; of our own
Milton. But though cut off from the sight of Nature&rsquo;s
works, he dedicated himself to their study. He saw them
through the eyes of the admirable woman whom he married;
his philosophical reasonings pointed out to her all that he
wanted to ascertain; and as she reported to him from time
to time the results of his ingenious experiments, he was
enabled to complete, by diligent investigation, one of the
most accurate and satisfactory accounts of the habits of bees
which had ever been produced.</p>

<p>It had long been known that the bees of a hive consist of
three sorts, which was ascertained by M. Réaumur to be
distinguished as workers or neuters, constituting the bulk
of the population; drones or males, the least numerous class;
and a single female, the queen and mother of the colony.
Schirach subsequently discovered the very extraordinary
fact, which Huber and others have proved beyond doubt,
that when a hive is accidentally deprived of a queen, the
grub of a worker can be and is fed in a particular manner
so as to become a queen and supply the loss.<a name="FNanchor_Z" id="FNanchor_Z"></a><a href="#Footnote_Z" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a> But another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
discovery of M. Huber is of more importance to the subject
of architecture now before us. By minute research he
ascertained that the workers which had been considered by
former naturalists to be all alike, are divided into two
important classes, nurse-bees and wax-makers.</p>

<p>The <i>nurse-bees</i> are rather smaller than the wax-workers,
and even when gorged with honey their belly does not, as
in the others, appear distended. Their business is to collect
honey, and impart it to their companions; to feed and take
care of the young grubs, and to complete the combs and
cells which have been founded by the others; but they are
not charged with provisioning the hive.</p>

<p>The <i>wax-workers</i>, on the other hand, are not only a little
larger, but their stomach, when gorged with honey, is
capable of considerable distension, as M. Huber proved by
repeated experiments. He also ascertained that neither of
the varieties can alone fulfil all the functions shared among
the workers of a hive. He painted those of each class with
different colours, in order to study their proceedings, and
their labours were not interchanged. In another experiment,
after supplying a hive deprived of a queen with brood
and pollen, he saw the nurse-bees quickly occupied in the
nutrition of the grubs, while those of the wax-working class
neglected them. When hives are full of combs, the wax-workers
disgorge their honey into the ordinary magazines,
making no wax; but if they want a reservoir for its reception,
and if their queen does not find cells ready made
wherein to lay her eggs, they retain the honey in the
stomach, and in twenty-four hours they produce wax. Then
the labour of constructing combs begins.</p>

<p>It might perhaps be supposed that, when the country
does not afford honey, the wax-workers consume the provision
stored up in the hive. But they are not permitted to
touch it. A portion of honey is carefully preserved, and
the cells containing it are protected by a waxen covering,
which is never removed except in case of extreme necessity,
and when honey is not to be otherwise procured. The cells
are at no time opened during summer; other reservoirs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
always exposed, contribute to the daily use of the community;
each bee, however, supplying itself from them
with nothing but what is required for present wants. Wax-workers
appear with large bellies at the entrance of their
hive only when the country affords a copious collection of
honey. From this it may be concluded that the production
of the waxy matter depends on a concurrence of circumstances
not invariably subsisting. Nurse-bees also produce
wax, but in a very inferior quantity to what is elaborated
by the real wax-workers. Another characteristic whereby
an attentive observer can determine the moment of bees
collecting sufficient honey to produce wax, is the strong
odour of both these substances from the hive, which is not
equally intense at any other time. From such data, it was
easy for M. Huber to discover whether the bees worked in
wax in his own hives, and in those of the other cultivators of
the district.</p>

<p>There is still another sort of bee, first observed by
Huber in 1809, which appear to be only casual inmates of
the hive, and which are driven forth to starve, or are killed
in conflict. They closely resemble the ordinary workers,
but are less hairy, and of a much darker colour. These
have been called <i>black bees</i>, and are supposed by Huber
to be defective bees;<a name="FNanchor_AA" id="FNanchor_AA"></a><a href="#Footnote_AA" class="fnanchor">[AA]</a> but Kirby and Spence conjecture
that they are toil-worn superannuated workers, of no further
use, and are therefore sacrificed, because burdensome to a
community which tolerates no unnecessary inmates.</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Preparation of Wax.</p>

<p>In order to build the beautiful combs, which every one
must have repeatedly seen and admired, it is indispensable
that the architect-bees should be provided with the materials&mdash;with
the wax, in short, of which they are principally formed.
Before we follow them, therefore, to the operation of building,
it may be necessary to inquire how the wax itself is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
procured. Here the discoveries of recent inquirers have
been little less singular and unexpected than in other
departments of the history of these extraordinary insects.
Now that it has been proved that wax is secreted by bees, it
is not a little amusing to read the accounts given by our
elder naturalists, of its being collected from flowers. Our
countryman, Thorley,<a name="FNanchor_AB" id="FNanchor_AB"></a><a href="#Footnote_AB" class="fnanchor">[AB]</a> appears to have been the first who
suspected the true origin of wax, and Wildman (1769) seems
also to have been aware of it; but Réaumur, and particularly
Bonnet, though both of them in general shrewd and accurate
observers, were partially deceived by appearances.</p>

<p>The bees, we are erroneously told, search for wax "upon
all sorts of trees and plants, but especially the rocket, the
simple poppy, and in general all kinds of flowers. They
amass it with their hair, with which their whole body is
invested. It is something pleasant to see them roll in the
yellow dust which falls from the chives to the bottom of the
flowers, and then return covered with the same grains; but
their best method of gathering the wax, especially when it
is not very plentiful, is to carry away all the little particles
of it with their jaws and fore feet, to press the wax upon
them into little pellets, and slide them one at a time, with
their middle feet, into a socket or cavity, that opens at their
hinder feet, and serves to keep the burthen fixed and steady
till they return home. They are sometimes exposed to inconveniences
in this work by the motion of the air, and the
delicate texture of the flowers, which bend under their feet
and hinder them from packing up their booty, on which
occasions they fix themselves in some steady place, where
they press the wax into a mass, and wind it round their
legs, making frequent returns to the flowers; and when they
have stocked themselves with a sufficient quantity, they
immediately repair to their habitation. Two men, in the
compass of a whole day, could not amass so much as two
little balls of wax; and yet they are no more than the common
burthen of a single bee, and the produce of one journey.
Those who are employed in collecting the wax from flowers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
are assisted by their companions, who attend them at the door
of the hive, ease them of their load at their arrival, brush
their feet, and shake out the two balls of wax; upon which
the others return to the fields to gather new treasure, while
those who disburthened them convey their charge to the
magazine. But some bees, again, when they have brought
their load home, carry it themselves to the lodge, and there
deliver it, laying hold of one end by their hinder feet, and
with their middle feet sliding it out of the cavity that contained
it; but this is evidently a work of supererogation
which they are not obliged to perform. The packets of wax
continue a few moments in the lodge, till a set of officers
come, who are charged with a third commission, which is to
knead this wax with their feet, and spread it out into different
sheets, laid one above another. This is the unwrought wax,
which is easily distinguished to be the produce of different
flowers, by the variety of colours that appear on each sheet.
When they afterwards come to work, they knead it over
again; they purify and whiten, and then reduce it to a
uniform colour. They use this wax with a wonderful frugality;
for it is easy to observe that the whole family is conducted
by prudence, and all their actions regulated by good
government. Everything is granted to necessity, but nothing
to superfluity; not the least grain of wax is neglected, and if
they waste it, they are frequently obliged to provide more;
at those very times when they want to get their provision of
honey, they take off the wax that closed the cells, and carry it
to the magazine."<a name="FNanchor_AC" id="FNanchor_AC"></a><a href="#Footnote_AC" class="fnanchor">[AC]</a></p>

<p>Réaumur hesitated in believing that this was a correct view
of the subject, from observing the great difference between
wax and pollen; but he was inclined to think the pollen
might be swallowed, partially digested, and disgorged in the
form of a kind of paste. Schirach also mentions, that it was
remarked by a certain Lusatian, that wax comes from the
rings of the body, because, on withdrawing a bee while it is
at work, and extending its body, the wax may be seen there in
the form of scales.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>The celebrated John Hunter shrewdly remarked that the
pellets of pollen seen on the thighs of bees are of different
colours on different bees, while the shade of the new-made
comb is always uniform; and therefore he concluded that
pollen was not the origin of wax. Pollen also, he observed,
is collected with greater avidity for old hives, where the
comb is complete, than for those where it is only begun,
which would hardly be the case were it the material of wax.
He found that when the weather was cold and wet in
June, so that a young swarm was prevented from going
abroad, as much comb was constructed as had been made
in an equal time when the weather was favourable and
fine.</p>

<p>The pellets of pollen on the thighs being thence proved
not to be wax, he came to the conclusion that it was an
external secretion, originating between the plates of the belly.
When he first observed this, he felt not a little embarrassed
to explain the phenomenon, and doubted whether new plates
were forming, or whether bees cast their old ones as lobsters
do their shell. By melting the scales, he ascertained at least
that they were wax; and his opinion was confirmed by the
fact, that the scales are only to be found during the season
when the combs are constructed. But he did not succeed in
completing the discovery by observing the bees actually
detach the scales, though he conjectured they might be taken
up by others, if they were once shaken out from between the
rings.<a name="FNanchor_AD" id="FNanchor_AD"></a><a href="#Footnote_AD" class="fnanchor">[AD]</a></p>

<p>We need not be so much surprised at mistakes committed
upon this subject, when we recollect that honey itself was
believed by the ancients to be an emanation of the air&mdash;a dew
that descended upon flowers, as if it had a limited commission
to fall only on them. The exposure and correction of error is
one of the first steps to genuine knowledge; and when we are
aware of the stumbling-blocks which have interrupted the
progress of others, we can always travel more securely in the
way of truth.</p>

<p>That wax is secreted is proved both by the wax-pouches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
within the rings of the abdomen, and by actual experiment.
Huber and others fed bees entirely upon honey or sugar, and,
notwithstanding, wax was produced and combs formed as if
they had been at liberty to select their food. &ldquo;When bees
were confined,&rdquo; says M. Huber, "for the purpose of discovering
whether honey was sufficient for the production of wax,
they supported their captivity patiently, and showed uncommon
perseverance in rebuilding their combs as we removed
them. Our experiments required the presence of grubs;
honey and water had to be provided; the bees were to be
supplied with combs containing brood, and at the same time
it was necessary to confine them, that they might not seek
pollen abroad. Having a swarm by chance, which had become
useless from sterility of the queen, we devoted it for our
investigation in one of my leaf-hives, which was glazed on
both sides. We removed the queen, and substituted combs
containing eggs and young grubs, but no cell with farina;
even the smallest particle of the substance which John
Hunter conjectured to be the basis of the nutriment of the
young was taken away.</p>

<p>"Nothing remarkable occurred during the first and second
day: the bees brooded over the young, and seemed to take
an interest in them; but at sunset on the third a loud noise
was heard in the hive. Impatient to discover the reason, we
opened a shutter, and saw all in confusion; the brood was
abandoned, the workers ran in disorder over the combs,
thousands rushed towards the lower part of the hive, and
those about the entrance gnawed at its grating. Their
design was not equivocal; they wished to quit their prison.
Some imperious necessity evidently obliged them to seek
elsewhere what they could not find in the hive; and apprehensive
that they might perish if I restrained them longer from
yielding to their instinct, I set them at liberty. The whole
swarm escaped, but the hour being unfavourable for their
collections, they flew around the hive, and did not depart far
from it. Increasing darkness and the coolness of the air
compelled them very soon to return. Probably these circumstances
calmed their agitation; for we observed them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
peaceably remounting their combs; order seemed re-established,
and we took advantage of this moment to close the
hive.</p>

<p>"Next day, the 19th of July, we saw the rudiments of two
royal cells, which the bees had formed on one of the brood-combs.
This evening, at the same hour as on the preceding,
we again heard a loud buzzing in the closed hive; agitation
and disorder rose to the highest degree, and we were again
obliged to let the swarm escape. The bees did not remain
long absent from their habitation; they quieted and returned
as before. We remarked on the 20th that the royal cells
had not been continued, as would have been the case in the
ordinary state of things. A great tumult took place in the
evening; the bees appeared to be in a delirium; we set them
at liberty, and order was restored on their return. Their
captivity having endured five days, we thought it needless to
protract it farther; besides, we were desirous of knowing
whether the brood was in a suitable condition, and if it had
made the usual progress; and we wished also to try to
discover what might be the cause of the periodical agitation
of the bees. M. Burnens (the assistant of Huber), having
exposed the two brood-combs, the royal cells were immediately
recognised; but it was obvious that they had not been
enlarged. Why should they? Neither eggs, grubs, nor that
kind of paste peculiar to the individuals of their species were
there! The other cells were vacant likewise; no brood, not
an atom of paste, was in them. Thus, the worms had died of
hunger. Had we precluded the bees from all means of sustenance
by removing the farina? To decide this point, it
was necessary to confide other brood to the care of the same
insects, now giving them abundance of pollen. They had
not been enabled to make any collections while we examined
their combs. On this occasion they escaped in an apartment
where the windows were shut; and after substituting young
worms for those they had allowed to perish, we returned
them to their prison. Next day we remarked that they had
resumed courage; they had consolidated the combs, and
remained on the brood. They were then provided with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
fragments of combs, where other workers had stored up
farina; and to be able to observe what they did with it, we
took this substance from some of their cells, and spread it on
the board of the hive. The bees soon discovered both the
farina in the combs and what we had exposed to them. They
crowded to the cells, and also descending to the bottom of
the hives, took the pollen grain by grain in their teeth, and
conveyed it to their mouths. Those that had eaten it most
greedily mounted the combs before the rest, and stopping on
the cells of the young worms, inserted their heads, and
remained there for a certain time. M. Burnens opened one
of the divisions of the hive gently, and powdered the workers,
for the purpose of recognising them when they should ascend
the combs. He observed them during several hours, and by
this means ascertained that they took so great a quantity of
pollen only to impart it to their young. Then withdrawing
the portions of comb which had been placed by us on the
board of the hive, we saw that the pollen had been sensibly
diminished in quantity. They were returned to the bees, to
augment their provision still further, for the purpose of
extending the experiment. The royal, as well as several
common, cells were soon closed; and, on opening the hive,
all the worms were found to have prospered. Some still had
their food before them; the cells of others that had spun
were shut with a waxen covering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We witnessed these facts repeatedly, and always with
equal interest. They so decisively prove the regard of the
bees towards the grubs which they are intrusted with rearing,
that we shall not seek for any other explanation of their
conduct. Another fact, no less extraordinary, and much
more difficult to be accounted for, was exhibited by bees
constrained to work in wax, several times successively, from
the syrup of sugar. Towards the close of the experiment they
ceased to feed the young, though in the beginning these had
received the usual attention. They even frequently dragged
them from their cells, and carried them out of the hive.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_AE" id="FNanchor_AE"></a><a href="#Footnote_AE" class="fnanchor">[AE]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Wiston, of Germantown, in the United States, mentions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
a fact conclusive on this subject. &ldquo;I had,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;a late
swarm last summer, which, in consequence of the drought,
filled only one box with honey. As it was late in the season,
and the food collected would not enable the bees to subsist
for the winter, I shut up the hive, and gave them half-a-pint
of honey every day. They immediately set to work, filled
the empty cells, and then constructed new cells enough to
fill another box, in which they deposited the remainder of
the honey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A more interesting proof is thus related by the same
gentleman: &ldquo;In the summer of 1824, I traced some wild
bees, which had been feeding on the flowers in my meadow,
to their home in the woods, and which I found in the body
of an oak-tree, exactly fifty feet above the ground. Having
caused the entrance to the hive to be closed by an expert
climber, the limbs were separated in detail, until the trunk
alone was left standing. To the upper extremity of this,
a tackle-fall was attached so as to connect it with an
adjacent tree, and, a saw being applied below, the naked
trunk was cut through. When the immense weight was
lowered nearly to the earth, the ropes broke, and the mass
fell with a violent crash. The part of the tree which contained
the hive, separated by the saw, was conveyed to my
garden, and placed in a vertical position. On being released,
the bees issued out by thousands, and though alarmed, soon
became reconciled to the change of situation. By removing
a part of the top of the block the interior of the hive was
exposed to view, and the comb itself, nearly six feet in height,
was observed to have fallen down two feet below the roof of
the cavity. To repair the damage was the first object of the
labourers: in doing which, a large part of their store of
honey was expended, because it was at too late a season to
obtain materials from abroad. In the following February
these industrious but unfortunate insects issuing in a confused
manner from the hive, fell dead in thousands around its
entrance, the victims of a poverty created by their efforts to
repair the ruins of their habitation.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_AF" id="FNanchor_AF"></a><a href="#Footnote_AF" class="fnanchor">[AF]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>In another experiment, M. Huber confined a swarm so that
they had access to nothing beside honey, and five times
successively removed the combs with the precaution of preventing
the escape of the bees from the apartment. On each
occasion they produced new combs, which puts it beyond
dispute that honey is sufficient to effect the secretion of wax
without the aid of pollen. Instead of supplying the bees
with honey, they were subsequently fed, exclusively, on
pollen and fruit; but though they were kept in captivity for
eight days under a bell-glass, with a comb containing nothing
but farina, they neither made wax nor was any secreted under
the rings. In another series of experiments, in which bees
were fed with different sorts of sugar, it was found that
nearly one-sixth of the sugar was converted into wax, dark-coloured
sugar yielding more than double the quantity of
refined sugar.</p>

<p>It may not be out of place to subjoin the few anatomical
and physiological facts which have been ascertained by
Huber, Maddle, Jurine, and Latreille.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 322px;">
<img src="images/123.png" width="322" height="257" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Worker-bee, magnified&mdash;showing the position of the scales of Wax.</div>
</div>

<p>The first stomach of the worker-bee, according to Latreille,<a name="FNanchor_AG" id="FNanchor_AG"></a><a href="#Footnote_AG" class="fnanchor">[AG]</a>
is appropriated to the reception of honey, but this is never
found in the second stomach, which is surrounded with muscular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
rings, and from one end to the other very much resembles
a cask covered with hoops. It is within these rings
that the wax is produced; but the secreting vessels for this
purpose have hitherto escaped the researches of the acutest
naturalists. Huber, however, plausibly enough conjectures
that they are contained in the internal lining of the wax-pockets,
which consists of a cellular substance reticulated
with hexagons. The wax-pockets themselves, which are
concealed by the overlapping of the rings, may be seen by
pressing the abdomen of a worker-bee so as to lengthen it,
and separate the rings further from each other. When this
has been done, there may be seen on each of the four intermediate
hoops of the belly, and separated by what may be
called the keel (<i>carina</i>), two whitish-coloured pouches, of a
soft texture, and in the form of a trapezium. Within, the
little plates or scales of wax are produced from time to time,
and are removed and employed as we shall presently see.
We may remark, that it is chiefly the wax-workers which
produce the wax; for though the nurse-bees are furnished
with wax-pockets, they secrete it only in very small quantities;
while in the queen-bee, and the males or drones, no
pockets are discoverable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;All the scales,&rdquo; says Huber, &ldquo;are not alike in every
bee, for a difference is perceptible in consistence, shape, and
thickness; some are so thin and transparent as to require
a magnifier to be recognised, or we have been able to discover
nothing but spiculæ similar to those of water freezing.
Neither the spiculæ nor the scales rest immediately on the
membrane of the pocket, a slight liquid medium is interposed,
serving to lubricate the joinings of the rings, or to
render the extraction of the scales easier, as otherwise they
might adhere too firmly to the sides of the pockets.&rdquo; M.
Huber has seen the scales so large as to project beyond the
rings, being visible without stretching the segments, and of
a whitish yellow, from greater thickness lessening their
transparency. These shades of difference in the scales of
various bees, their enlarged dimensions, the fluid interposed
beneath them, the correspondence between the scale and the
size and form of the pockets, seem to infer the oozing of this
substance through the membranes whereon it is moulded.
He was confirmed in this opinion by the escape of a transparent
fluid on piercing the membrane, whose internal surface
seemed to be applied to the soft parts of the belly.
This he found coagulated in cooling, when it resembled
wax, and again liquefied on exposure to heat. The scales
themselves, also, melted and coagulated like wax.<a name="FNanchor_AH" id="FNanchor_AH"></a><a href="#Footnote_AH" class="fnanchor">[AH]</a></p>

<p>By chemical analysis, however, it appears that the wax
of the rings is a more simple substance than that which
composes the cells; for the latter is soluble in ether, and
in spirit of turpentine, while the former is insoluble in
ether, and but partially soluble in spirit of turpentine. It
should seem to follow, that if the substance found lying
under the rings be really the elements of wax, it undergoes
some subsequent preparation after it is detached; and that
the bees, in short, are capable of impregnating it with matter,
imparting to it whiteness and ductility, whereas in its unprepared
state it is only fusible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Propolis.</p>

<p>Wax is not the only material employed by bees in their
architecture. Beside this, they make use of a brown, odoriferous,
resinous substance, called <i>propolis</i>,<a name="FNanchor_AI" id="FNanchor_AI"></a><a href="#Footnote_AI" class="fnanchor">[AI]</a> more tenacious
and extensible than wax, and well adapted for cementing and
varnishing. It was strongly suspected by Réaumur that the
bees collected the propolis from those trees which are known
to produce a similar gummy resin, such as the poplar, the
birch, and the willow; but he was thrown into doubt by not
being able to detect the bees in the act of procuring it, and
by observing them to collect it where none of those trees, nor
any other of the same description, grew. His bees also
refused to make use of bitumen, and other resinous substances,
with which he supplied them, though Mr. Knight, as
we shall afterwards see, was more successful.<a name="FNanchor_AJ" id="FNanchor_AJ"></a><a href="#Footnote_AJ" class="fnanchor">[AJ]</a></p>

<p>Long before the time of Réaumur, however, Mouffet, in
his <i>Insectarum Theatrum</i>, quotes Cordus for the opinion that
propolis is collected from the buds of trees, such as the
poplar and birch; and Reim says it is collected from the
pine and fir.<a name="FNanchor_AK" id="FNanchor_AK"></a><a href="#Footnote_AK" class="fnanchor">[AK]</a> Huber at length set the question at rest; and
his experiments and observations are so interesting, that we
shall give them in his own words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For many years,&rdquo; says he, "I had fruitlessly endeavoured
to find them on trees producing an analogous substance,
though multitudes had been seen returning laden with it.</p>

<p>"In July, some branches of the wild poplar, which had
been cut since spring, with very large buds, full of a reddish,
viscous, odoriferous matter, were brought to me, and I planted
them in vessels before hives, in the way of the bees going
out to forage, so that they could not be insensible of their
presence. Within a quarter of an hour, they were visited by
a bee, which separating the sheath of a bud with its teeth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
drew out threads of the viscous substance, and lodged a pellet
of it in one of the baskets of its limbs; from another bud it
collected another pellet for the opposite limb, and departed
to the hive. A second bee took the place of the former in a
few minutes, following the same procedure. Young shoots
of poplar, recently cut, did not seem to attract these insects,
as their viscous matter had less consistence than the former.<a name="FNanchor_AL" id="FNanchor_AL"></a><a href="#Footnote_AL" class="fnanchor">[AL]</a></p>

<p>"Different experiments proved the identity of this substance
with the propolis; and now, having only to discover
how the bees applied it to use, we peopled a hive, so prepared
as to fulfil our views. The bees, building upwards, soon
reached the glass above; but, unable to quit their habitation,
on account of rain, they were three weeks without
bringing home propolis. Their combs remained perfectly
white until the beginning of July, when the state of the
atmosphere became more favourable for our observations.
Serene, warm weather engaged them to forage, and they
returned from the fields laden with a resinous gum, resembling
a transparent jelly, and having the colour and
lustre of the garnet. It was easily distinguished from the
farinaceous pellets then collected by other bees. The
workers bearing the propolis ran over the clusters, suspended
from the roof of the hive, and rested on the rods
supporting the combs, or sometimes stopped on the sides
of their dwelling, in expectation of their companions coming
to disencumber them of their burthen. We actually saw
two or three arrive, and carry the propolis from off the
limbs of each with their teeth. The upper part of the hive
exhibited the most animated spectacle; thither a multitude
of bees resorted from all quarters, to engage in the predominant
occupation of the collection, distribution, and application
of the propolis. Some conveyed that of which they
had unloaded the purveyors in their teeth, and deposited it
in heaps; others hastened, before its hardening, to spread
it out like a varnish, or formed it into strings, proportioned
to the interstices of the sides of the hives to be filled up.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Nothing could be more diversified than the operations
carried on.</p>

<p>"The bees, apparently charged with applying the propolis
within the cells, were easily distinguished from the
multitude of workers, by the direction of their heads towards
the horizontal pane forming the roof of the hive, and on
reaching it, they deposited their burthen nearly in the
middle of intervals separating the combs: then they conveyed
the propolis to the real place of its destination.
They suspended themselves by the claws of the hind legs
to points of support, afforded by the viscosity of the propolis
on the glass; and, as it were, swinging themselves backwards
and forwards, brought the heap of this substance nearer to
the cells at each impulse. Here the bees employed their
fore feet, which remained free, to sweep what the teeth had
detached, and to unite the fragments scattered over the glass,
which recovered all its transparency when the whole propolis
was brought to the vicinity of the cells.</p>

<p>"After some of the bees had smoothed down and cleaned
out the glazed cells, feeling the way with their antennæ,
one desisted, and having approached a heap of propolis,
drew out a thread with its teeth. This being broken off,
it was taken in the claws of the fore feet, and the bee, re-entering
the cell, immediately placed it in the angle of two
portions that had been smoothed, in which operation the fore
feet and teeth were used alternately; but probably proving
too clumsy, the thread was reduced and polished; and we
admired the accuracy with which it was adjusted when the
work was completed. The insect did not stop here: returning
to the cell, it prepared other parts of it to receive a
second thread, for which we did not doubt that the heap
would be resorted to. Contrary to our expectation, however,
it availed itself of the portion of the thread cut off on the
former occasion, arranged it in the appointed place, and gave
it all the solidity and finish of which it was susceptible.
Other bees completed the work which the first had begun:
and the sides of the cells were speedily secured with threads
of propolis, while some were also put on the orifices; but we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
could not seize the moment when they were varnished, though
it may be easily conceived how it is done."<a name="FNanchor_AM" id="FNanchor_AM"></a><a href="#Footnote_AM" class="fnanchor">[AM]</a></p>

<p>This is not the only use to which bees apply the propolis.
They are extremely solicitous to remove such insects or
foreign bodies as happen to get admission into the hive.
When so light as not to exceed their powers, they first kill
the insect with their stings, and then drag it out with their
teeth. But it sometimes happens, as was first observed by
Maraldi, and since by Réaumur and others, that an ill-fated
slug creeps into the hive: this is no sooner perceived than
it is attacked on all sides, and stung to death. But how are
the bees to carry out so heavy a burthen? Such a labour
would be in vain. To prevent the noxious smell which
would arise from its putrefaction, they immediately embalm
it, by covering every part of its body with propolis, through
which no effluvia can escape. When a snail with a shell gets
entrance, to dispose of it gives much less trouble and expense
to the bees. As soon as it receives the first wound from a
sting, it naturally retires within its shell. In this case, the
bees, instead of pasting it all over with propolis, content themselves
with gluing all round the margin of the shell, which is
sufficient to render the animal for ever immovably fixed.</p>

<p>Mr. Knight, the learned and ingenious President of the
Horticultural Society, discovered by accident an artificial
substance, more attractive than any of the resins experimentally
tried by Réaumur. Having caused the decorticated
part of a tree to be covered with a cement composed
of bees&rsquo;-wax and turpentine, he observed that this was
frequented by hive-bees, who, finding it to be a very good
propolis ready made, detached it from the tree with their
mandibles, and then, as usual, passed it from the first leg
to the second, and so on. When one bee had thus collected
its load, another often came behind and despoiled it of all
it had collected; a second and a third load were frequently
lost in the same manner; and yet the patient insect pursued
its operations without manifesting any signs of anger.<a name="FNanchor_AN" id="FNanchor_AN"></a><a href="#Footnote_AN" class="fnanchor">[AN]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Probably the latter circumstance, at which Mr. Knight
seems to have been surprised, was nothing more than an
instance of the division of labour so strikingly exemplified
in every part of the economy of bees.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 279px;">
<img src="images/130.png" width="279" height="260" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Structure of the legs of the Bee, for carrying propolis and pollen, magnified.</div>
</div>

<p>It may not be out of place here to describe the apparatus
with which the worker-bees are provided for the purpose of
carrying the propolis as well as the pollen of flowers to the
hive, and which has just been alluded to in the observations
of Mr. Knight. The shin or middle portion of the hind pair
of legs is actually formed into a triangular basket, admirably
adapted to this design. The bottom of this basket is composed
of a smooth, shining, horn-like substance, hollowed out
in the substance of the limb, and surrounded with a margin
of strong and thickly-set bristles. Whatever materials,
therefore, may be placed by the bee in the interior of this
basket, are secured from falling out by the bristles around it,
whose elasticity will even allow the load to be heaped beyond
their points without letting it fall.</p>

<p>In the case of propolis, when the bee is loading her
singular basket, she first kneads the piece she has detached
with her mandibles, till it becomes somewhat dry and less
adhesive, as otherwise it would stick to her limbs. This
preliminary process sometimes occupies nearly half an hour.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
She then passes it backwards by means of her feet to the
cavity of her basket, giving it two or three pats to make it
adhere; and when she adds a second portion to the first, she
often finds it necessary to pat it still harder. When she has
procured as much as the basket will conveniently hold, she
flies off with it to the hive.</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">The Building of the Cells.</p>

<p>The notion commonly entertained respecting glass hives
is altogether erroneous. Those who are unacquainted with
bees, imagine that, by means of a glass hive, all their proceedings
may be easily watched and recorded; but it is to
be remembered that bees are exceedingly averse to the
intrusion of light, and their first operation in such cases
is to close up every chink by which light can enter to disturb
them, either by clustering together, or by a plaster
composed of propolis. It consequently requires considerable
management and ingenuity, even with the aid of a glass
hive, to see them actually at work. M. Huber employed a
hive with leaves, which opened in the manner of a book;
and for some purposes he used a glass box, inserted in the
body of the hive, but easily brought into view by means of
screws.</p>

<p>But no invention hitherto contrived is sufficient to obviate
every difficulty. The bees are so eager to afford mutual
assistance, and for this purpose so many of them crowd
together in rapid succession, that the operations of individuals
can seldom be traced. Though this crowding, however,
appears to an observer to be not a little confused, it is
all regulated with admirable order, as has been ascertained
by Réaumur and other distinguished naturalists.</p>

<p>When bees begin to build the hive, they divide themselves
into bands, one of which produces materials for the
structure; another works upon these, and forms them into
a rough sketch of the dimensions and partitions of the cells.
All this is completed by the second band, who examine and
adjust the angles, remove the superfluous wax, and give the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
work its necessary perfection; and a third band brings provisions
to the labourers, who cannot leave their work. But
no distribution of food is made to those whose charge, in
collecting propolis and pollen, calls them to the field,
because it is supposed they will hardly forget themselves;
neither is any allowance made to those who begin the
architecture of the cells. Their province is very troublesome,
because they are obliged to level and extend, as well
as cut and adjust the wax to the dimensions required; but
then they soon obtain a dismission from this labour, and
retire to the fields to regale themselves with food, and wear
off their fatigue with a more agreeable employment. Those
who succeed them, draw their mouth, their feet, and the
extremity of their body, several times over all the work,
and never desist till the whole is polished and completed;
and as they frequently need refreshments, and yet are not
permitted to retire, there are waiters always attending,
who serve them with provisions when they require them.
The labourer who has an appetite, bends down his trunk
before the caterer to intimate that he has an inclination to
eat, upon which the other opens his bag of honey, and pours
out a few drops: these may be distinctly seen rolling
through the hole of his trunk, which insensibly swells in
every part the liquor flows through. When this little repast
is over, the labourer returns to his work, and his body and
feet repeat the same motions as before.<a name="FNanchor_AO" id="FNanchor_AO"></a><a href="#Footnote_AO" class="fnanchor">[AO]</a></p>

<p>Before they can commence building, however, when a
colony or swarm migrates from the original hive to a new
situation, it is necessary first to collect propolis, with which
every chink and cranny in the place where they mean to
build may be carefully stopped up; and secondly, that a
quantity of wax be secreted by the wax-workers to form
the requisite cells. The secretion of wax, it would appear,
goes on best when the bees are in a state of repose; and the
wax-workers, accordingly, suspend themselves in the interior
in an extended cluster, like the curtain which is composed
of a series of intertwined festoons or garlands, crossing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
each other in all directions&mdash;the uppermost bee maintaining
its position by laying hold of the roof with its fore legs,
and the succeeding one by laying hold of the hind legs of
the first.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Curtain of Wax-workers secreting wax.</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;A person,&rdquo; says Réaumur, &ldquo;must have been born devoid
of curiosity not to take interest in the investigation of such
wonderful proceedings.&rdquo; Yet Réaumur himself seems not
to have understood that the bees suspended themselves
in this manner to secrete wax, but merely, as he imagined,
to recruit themselves by rest for renewing their labours.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
The bees composing the festooned curtain are individually
motionless; but this curtain is, notwithstanding, kept
moving by the proceedings in the interior; for the nurse-bees
never form any portion of it, and continue their activity&mdash;a
distinction with which Réaumur was unacquainted.</p>

<p>Although there are many thousand labourers in a hive,
they do not commence foundations for combs in several
places at once, but wait till an individual bee has selected
a site, and laid the foundation of a comb, which serves as
a directing mark for all that are to follow. Were we not
expressly told by so accurate an observer as Huber, we
might hesitate to believe that bees, though united in what
appears to be an harmonious monarchy, are strangers to
subordination, and subject to no discipline. Hence it is,
that though many bees work on the same comb, they do
not appear to be guided by any simultaneous impulse.
The stimulus which moves them is successive. An individual
bee commences each operation, and several others
successively apply themselves to accomplish the same purpose.
Each bee appears, therefore, to act individually,
either as directed by the bees preceding it, or by the state
of advancement in which it finds the work it has to proceed
with. If there be anything like unanimous consent, it is
the inaction of several thousand workers while a single
individual proceeds to determine and lay down the foundation
of the first comb. Réaumur regrets that, though he
could by snatches detect a bee at work in founding cells or
perfecting their structure, his observations were generally
interrupted by the crowding of other bees between him and
the little builder. He was therefore compelled rather to
infer the different steps of their procedure from an examination
of the cells when completed, than from actual observation.
The ingenuity of Huber, even under all the disadvantages
of blindness, succeeded in tracing the minutest operations
of the workers from the first waxen plate of the foundation.
We think the narrative of the discoverer&rsquo;s experiments, as
given by himself, will be more interesting than any abstract
of it which we could furnish:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Having taken a large bell-shaped glass receiver, we
glued thin wooden slips to the arch at certain intervals,
because the glass itself was too smooth to admit of the
bees supporting themselves on it. A swarm, consisting
of some thousand workers, several hundred males, and a
fertile queen, was introduced, and they soon ascended to
the top. Those first gaining the slips fixed themselves
there by the fore-feet; others, scrambling up the sides,
joined them, by holding their legs with their own, and
they thus formed a kind of chain, fastened by the two ends
to the upper parts of the receiver, and served as ladders or
a bridge to the workers enlarging their number. The latter
were united in a cluster, hanging like an inverted pyramid
from the top to the bottom of the hive.</p>

<p>"The country then affording little honey, we provided the
bees with syrup of sugar, in order to hasten their labour.
They crowded to the edge of a vessel containing it; and,
having satisfied themselves, returned to the group. We were
now struck with the absolute repose of this hive, contrasted
with the usual agitation of bees. Meanwhile, the nurse-bees
alone went to forage in the country; they returned with
pollen, kept guard at the entrance of the hive, cleansed it,
and stopped up its edges with propolis. The wax-workers
remained motionless about fifteen hours: the curtain of bees,
consisting always of the same individuals, assured us that
none replaced them. Some hours later, we remarked that
almost all these individuals had wax scales under the rings;
and next day this phenomenon was still more general. The
bees forming the external layer of the cluster, having now
somewhat altered their position, enabled us to see their
bellies distinctly. By the projection of the wax scales, the
rings seemed edged with white. The curtain of bees became
rent in several places, and some commotion began to be
observed in the hive.</p>

<p>"Convinced that the combs would originate in the centre
of the swarm, our whole attention was then directed towards
the roof of the glass. A worker at this time detached itself
from one of the central festoons of the cluster, separated itself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
from the crowd, and, with its head, drove away the bees at
the beginning of the row in the middle of the arch, turning
round to form a space an inch or more in diameter, in which
it might move freely. It then fixed itself in the centre of the
space thus cleared.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 182px;">
<img src="images/136.png" width="182" height="100" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Wax-worker laying the foundation of the first Cell.</div>
</div>

<p>"The worker now employing the pincers at the joint of
one of the third pair of its limbs, seized a scale of wax projecting
from a ring, and brought it forward to its mouth with
the claws of its fore-legs, where it appeared in a vertical
position. We remarked that, with its claws, it turned the
wax in every necessary direction; that the edge of the scale
was immediately broken down, and the fragments having
been accumulated in the hollow of the mandibles, issued forth
like a very narrow ribbon, impregnated with a frothy liquid
by the tongue. The tongue itself assumed the most varied
shapes, and executed the most complicated operations,&mdash;being
sometimes flattened like a trowel, and at other times pointed
like a pencil; and, after imbuing the whole substance of the
ribbon, pushed it forward again into the mandibles, whence it
was drawn out a second time, but in an opposite direction.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 330px;">
<img src="images/137.png" width="330" height="446" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Curtain of Wax-workers (see <a href="#Page_132">p. 132</a>).</div>
</div>

<p>"At length the bee applied these particles of wax to the
vault of the hive, where the saliva impregnating them promoted
their adhesion, and also communicated a whiteness
and opacity which were wanting when the scales were
detached from the rings. Doubtless this process was to give
the wax that ductility and tenacity belonging to its perfect
state. The bee then separated those portions not yet applied
to use with its mandibles, and with the same organs afterwards
arranged them at pleasure. The founder bee, a name appropriated
to this worker, repeated the same operation, until all
the fragments, worked up and impregnated with the fluid,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
were attached to the vault, when it repeated the preceding
operations on the part of the scale yet kept apart, and again
united to the rest what was obtained from it. A second and
third scale were similarly treated by the same bee; yet the
work was only sketched; for the worker did nothing but
accumulate the particles of wax together. Meanwhile the
founder, quitting its position, disappeared amidst its companions.
Another, with wax under the rings, succeeded it,
which suspending itself to the same spot, withdrew a scale
by the pincers of the hind legs, and passing it through its
mandibles, prosecuted the work; and taking care to make its
deposit in a line with the former, it united their extremities.
A third worker, detaching itself from the interior of the
cluster, now came and reduced some of the scales to paste,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and put them near the materials accumulated by its companions,
but not in a straight line. Another bee, apparently
sensible of the defect, removed the misplaced wax before our
eyes, and carrying it to the former heap, deposited it there,
exactly in the order and direction pointed out.</p>

<p>"From all these operations was produced a block of a
rugged surface, hanging down from the arch, without any
perceptible angle, or any traces of cells. It was a simple
wall, or ridge, running in a straight line, and without the
least inflection, two-thirds of an inch in length, above two-thirds
of a cell, or two lines, high, and declining towards the
extremities. We have seen other foundation walls from an
inch to an inch and a half long, the form being always the
same; but none ever of greater height.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The vacuity in the centre of the cluster had permitted
us to discover the first man&oelig;uvres of the bees, and the art
with which they laid the foundations of their edifices. However,
it was filled up too soon for our satisfaction; for workers
collecting on both faces of the wall obstructed our view of
their further operations.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_AP" id="FNanchor_AP"></a><a href="#Footnote_AP" class="fnanchor">[AP]</a></p>

<p class="caption2">ARCHITECTURE OF THE HIVE-BEE CONTINUED&mdash;FORM OF
THE CELLS.</p>


<p>The obstruction of which M. Huber complains only operated
as a stimulus to his ingenuity in contriving how he
might continue his interesting observations. From the time
of Pappus to the present day, mathematicians have applied
the principles of geometry to explain the construction of the
cells of a bee-hive; but though their extraordinary regularity,
and wonderfully-selected form, had so often been
investigated by men of the greatest talent, and skilled in all
the refinements of science, the process by which they are constructed,
involving also the causes of their regularity of form,
had not been traced till M. Huber devoted himself to the
inquiry.</p>

<p>As the wax-workers secrete only a limited quantity of wax,
it is indispensably requisite that as little as possible of it
should be consumed, and that none of it should be wasted.
Bees, therefore, as M. Réaumur well remarks,<a name="FNanchor_AQ" id="FNanchor_AQ"></a><a href="#Footnote_AQ" class="fnanchor">[AQ]</a> have to solve
this difficult geometrical problem:&mdash;a quantity of wax being
given, to form of it similar and equal cells of a determinate
capacity, but of the largest size in proportion to the quantity
of matter employed, and disposed in such a manner as to
occupy the least possible space in the hive. This problem
is solved by bees in all its conditions. The cylindrical form
would seem to be best adapted to the shape of the insect;
but had the cells been cylindrical, they could not have been
applied to each other without leaving a vacant and superfluous
space between every three contiguous cells. Had the cells,
on the other hand, been square or triangular, they might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
have been constructed without unnecessary vacancies; but
these forms would have both required more material, and have
been very unsuitable to the shape of a bee&rsquo;s body. The six-sided
form of the cells obviates every objection; and while
it fulfils the conditions of the problem, it is equally adapted
with a cylinder to the shape of the bee.</p>

<p>M. Réaumur further remarks, that the base of each cell,
instead of forming a plane, is usually composed of three
pieces in the shape of the diamonds on playing cards, and
placed in such a manner as to form a hollow pyramid. This
structure, it may be observed, imparts a greater degree of
strength, and, still keeping the solution of the problem in
view, gives a great capacity with the smallest expenditure of
material. This has actually, indeed, been ascertained by
mathematical measurement and calculation. Maraldi, the
inventor of glass hives, determined, by minutely measuring
these angles, that the greater were 109&deg; 28&rsquo;, and the smaller
70&deg; 32&rsquo;; and M. Réaumur, being desirous to know why these
particular angles are selected, requested M. K&oelig;nig, a skilful
mathematician (without informing him of his design, or telling
him of Maraldi&rsquo;s researches), to determine by calculation
what ought to be the angle of a six-sided cell, with a concave
pyramidal base, formed of three similar and equal rhomboid
plates, so that the least possible matter should enter into its
construction. By employing what geometricians denominate
the <i>infinitesimal calculus</i>, M. K&oelig;nig found that the angles
should be 109&deg; 26&rsquo; for the greater, and 70&deg; 34&rsquo; for the
smaller, or about two-sixtieths of a degree, more or less, than
the actual angles made choice of by bees. The equality of
inclination in the angles has also been said to facilitate the
construction of the cells.</p>

<p>M. Huber adds to these remarks, that the cells of the first
row, by which the whole comb is attached to the roof of a
hive, are not like the rest; for, instead of six sides, they have
only five, of which the roof forms one. The base, also, is in
these different, consisting of three pieces on the face of the
comb, and on the other side of two: one of these only is
diamond-shaped, while the other two are of an irregular four-sided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
figure. This arrangement, by bringing the greatest
number of points in contact with the interior surface, insures
the stability of the comb.</p>

<img src="images/141.png" width="248" height="188" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Arrangement of Cells.</div>
</div>

<p>It may, however, be said not to be quite certain, that
Réaumur and others have not ascribed to bees the merit of
ingenious mathematical contrivance and selection, when the
construction of the cells may more probably originate in the
form of their mandibles and the other instruments employed
in their operations. In the case of other insects, we have,
both in the preceding and subsequent pages of this volume,
repeatedly noticed, that they use their bodies, or parts thereof,
as the standards of measurement and modelling; and it
is not impossible that bees may proceed on a similar principle.
M. Huber replies to this objection, that bees are not provided
with instruments corresponding to the angles of their
cells; for there is no more resemblance between these and
the form of their mandibles, than between the chisel of the
sculptor and the work which he produces. The head, he
thinks, does not furnish any better explanation. He admits
that the antennæ are very flexible, so as to enable the insects
to follow the outline of every object; but concludes that
neither their structure, nor that of the limbs and mandibles,
are adequate to explain the form of the cells, though all these
are employed in the operations of building,&mdash;the effect,
according to him, depending entirely on the object which the
insect proposes.</p>

<p>We shall now follow M. Huber in the experiments which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
he contrived, in order to observe the operations of the bees
subsequent to their laying a foundation for the first cell;
and we shall again quote from his own narrative:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It appeared to me,&rdquo; he says, "that the only method of
isolating the architects, and bringing them individually into
view, would be to induce them to change the direction of
their operations and work upwards.</p>

<p>"I had a box made twelve inches square and nine deep,
with a moveable glass lid. Combs, full of brood, honey, and
pollen, were next selected from one of my leaf-hives, as containing
what might interest the bees, and being cut into
pieces a foot long, and four inches deep, they were arranged
vertically at the bottom of the box, at the same intervals as
the insects themselves usually leave between them. A small
slip of wooden lath covered the upper edge of each. It was
not probable that the bees would attempt to found new combs
on the glass roof of the box, because its smoothness precluded
the swarm from adhering to it; therefore, if disposed
to build, they could do so over the slips resting on the combs,
which left a vacuity five inches high above them. As we
had foreseen, the swarm with which this box was peopled
established itself among the combs below. We then observed
the nurse-bees displaying their natural activity. They dispersed
themselves throughout the hive, to feed the young
grubs, to clear out their lodgment, and adapt it for their
convenience. Certainly, the combs, which were roughly cut
to fit the bottom of the box, and in some parts damaged,
appeared to them shapeless and misplaced; for they speedily
commenced their reparation. They beat down the old wax,
kneaded it between their teeth, and thus formed binding
materials to consolidate them. We were astonished beyond
expression by such a multitude of workers employed at once
in labours to which it did not appear they should have been
called, at their coincidence, their zeal, and their prudence.</p>

<p>"But it was still more wonderful, that about half the
numerous population took no part in the proceedings, remaining
motionless, while the others fulfilled the functions
required. The wax-workers, in a state of absolute repose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
recalled our former observations. Gorged with the honey
we had put within their reach, and continuing in this
condition during twenty-four hours, wax was formed under
their rings, and was now ready to be put in operation. To
our great satisfaction, we soon saw a little foundation-wall
rising on one of the slips that we had prepared to receive the
superstructure. No obstacle was offered to the progress of
our observations; and for the second time we beheld both
the undertaking of the founder-bee, and the successive labours
of several wax-workers, in forming the foundation-wall.
Would that my readers could share the interest which the
view of these architects inspired!</p>

<p>"This foundation, originally very small, was enlarged as
the work required; while they excavated on one side a
hollow, of about the width of a common cell, and on the
opposite surface two others somewhat more elongated. The
middle of the single cell corresponded exactly to the partition
separating the latter: the arches of these excavations, projecting
by the accumulation of wax, were converted into
ridges in a straight line; whence the cells of the first row
were composed of five sides, considering the slip as one side,
and those of the second row, of six sides.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 428px;">
<img src="images/143.png" width="428" height="96" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Foundation-wall enlarged, and the Cells commenced.</div>
</div>

<p>"The interior conformation of the cavities, apparently,
was derived from the position of their respective outlines.
It seemed that the bees, endowed with an admirable delicacy
of feeling, directed their teeth principally to the place where
the wax was thickest; that is, the parts where other workers
on the opposite side had accumulated it; and this explains why
the bottom of the cell is excavated in an angular direction
behind the projection on the sides of which the sides of the
corresponding cells are to rise. The largest of the excavations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
which was opposite to three others, was divided into
three parts, while the excavations of the first row on the
other face, applied against this one, were composed of only
two.</p>

<p>"In consequence of the manner in which the excavations
were opposed to each other, those of the second row, and all
subsequent, partially applied to three cavities, were composed
of three equal diamond-shaped lozenges. I may here remark,
that each part of the labour of bees appears the natural result
of what has preceded it: therefore, chance has no share in
these admirable combinations.</p>

<p>"A foundation-wall rose above the slip like a minute
vertical partition, five or six lines long, two lines high, but
only half a line in thickness; the edge circular, and the
surface rough. Quitting the cluster among the combs, a
nurse-bee mounted the slip, turned around the block, and
visiting both sides, began to work actively in the middle.
It removed as much wax with its teeth as might equal the
diameter of a common cell; and after kneading and moistening
the particles, deposited them on the edge of the excavation.
This insect having laboured some seconds, retired,
and was soon replaced by another; a third continued the
work, raising the margin of the edges, now projecting from
the cavity, and with assistance of its teeth and feet fixing the
particles, so as to give these edges a straighter form. More
than twenty bees successively participated in the same work;
and when the cavity was little above a line and a half in
height, though equalling a cell in width, a bee left the
swarm, and after encircling the block, commenced its operations
on the opposite face, where yet untouched. But its
teeth acting only on one half of this side, the hollow which
it formed was opposite to only one of the slight prominences
bordering the first cavity. Nearly at the same time another
worker began on the right of the face that had been untouched,
wherein both were occupied in forming cavities
which may be designed the second and third; and they also
were replaced by substitutes. These two latter cavities were
separated only by the common margin, framed of particles of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
wax withdrawn from them; which margin corresponded with
the centre of the cavity on the opposite surface. The
foundation-wall itself was still of insufficient dimensions to
admit the full diameter of a cell: but while the excavations
were deepened, wax-workers, extracting their scales of wax,
applied them in enlarging its circumference; so that it rose
nearly two lines further around the circular arch. The
nurse-bees, which appeared more especially charged with
sculpturing the cells, being then enabled to continue their
outlines, prolonged the cavities, and heightened their margins
on the new addition of wax.</p>

<p>"The arch, formed by the edge of each of these cavities,
was next divided as by two equal chords, in the line of which
the bees formed stages or projecting borders, or margins
meeting at an obtuse angle: the cavities now had four
margins, two lateral and perpendicular to the supporting slip,
and two oblique, which were shorter.</p>

<p>"Meantime, it became more difficult to follow the operations
of the bees, from their frequently interposing their heads
between the eye of the observer and the bottom of the cell;
but the partition, whereon their teeth laboured, had become
so transparent as to expose what passed on the other side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cavities of which we speak formed the bottom of
the first three cells; and while the bees engaged were
advancing them to perfection, other workers commenced
sketching a second row of cells above the first, and partly
behind those in front&mdash;for, in general, their labour proceeds
by combination. We cannot say, &lsquo;When bees have finished
this cell, they will begin new ones;&rsquo; but, &lsquo;while particular
workers advance a certain portion, we are certain that others
will carry on the adjacent cells.&rsquo; Further, the work begun
on one face of the comb is already the commencement of that
which is to follow on the reverse. All this depends on a
reciprocal relation, or a mutual connexion of the parts,
rendering the whole subservient to each other. It is undoubted,
therefore, that slight irregularities on the front will
affect the form of the cells on the back of the comb.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_AR" id="FNanchor_AR"></a><a href="#Footnote_AR" class="fnanchor">[AR]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>
<p>When they have in this manner worked the bottoms of the
first row of cells into the required forms, some of the nurse-bees
finish them by imparting a sort of polish, while others
proceed to cut out the rudiments of a second row from a fresh
wall of wax which has been built in the meanwhile by the
wax-workers, and also on the opposite side of this wall; for
a comb of cells is always double, being arranged in two
layers, placed end to end. The cells of this second row are
engrafted on the borders of cavities hollowed out in the wall,
being founded by the nurse-bees, bringing the contour of all
the bottoms, which is at first unequal, to the same level; and
this level is kept uniform in the margins of the cells till they
are completed. At first sight nothing appears more simple
than adding wax to the margins; but from the inequalities
occasioned by the shape of the bottom, the bees must accumulate
wax on the depressions, in order to bring them to a level.
It follows accordingly that the surface of a new comb is not
quite flat, there being a progressive slope produced as the
work proceeds, and the comb being therefore in the form of a
lens, the thickness decreasing towards the edge, and the last-formed
cells being shallower or shorter than those preceding
them. So long as there is room for the enlargement of the
comb, this thinning of its edge may be remarked; but as soon
as the space within the hive prevents its enlargement, the
cells are made equal, and two flat and level surfaces are
produced.</p>

<p>M. Huber observed, that while sketching the bottom of a
cell, before there was any upright margin on the reverse,
their pressure on the still soft and flexible wax gave rise to
a projection, which sometimes caused a breach of the partition.
This, however, was soon repaired, but a slight prominence
always remained on the opposite surface, to the right
and left of which they placed themselves to begin a new
excavation; and they heaped up part of the materials between
the two flutings formed by their labour. The ridge thus
formed becomes a guide to the direction which the bees are
to follow for their vertical furrow of the front cell.</p>

<p>We have already seen that the first cell determines the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
place of all that succeed it, and two of these are never, in
ordinary circumstances, begun in different parts of the hive
at the same time, as is alleged by some early writers. When
some rows of cells, however, have been completed in the first
comb, two other foundation-walls are begun, one on each side
of it, at the exact distance of one-third of an inch, which is
sufficient to allow two bees employed on the opposite cells to
pass each other without jostling. These new walls are also
parallel to the former; and two more are afterwards begun
exterior to the second, and at the same parallel distance.
The combs are uniformly enlarged, and lengthened in a
progression proportioned to the priority of their origin; the
middle comb being always advanced beyond the two adjoining
ones by several rows of cells, and these again beyond the
ones exterior to them. Did the bees lay the foundations of
all their combs at the same time, they would not find it easy
to preserve parallelism and an equality in their distances. It
may be remarked further, that beside the vacancies of half an
inch between the cells, which form what we call the highways
of the community, the combs are pierced in several places
with holes which serve as postern-gates for easy communication
from one to another, to prevent loss of time in going
round. The equal distance between the combs is of more
importance to the welfare of the hive than might at first
appear; for were they too distant, the bees would be so
scattered and dispersed, that they could not reciprocally
communicate the heat indispensable for hatching the eggs
and rearing the young. If the combs, on the other hand,
were closer, the bees could not traverse the intervals with
the freedom necessary to facilitate the work of the hive.
On the approach of winter, they sometimes elongate the
cells which contain honey, and thus contract the intervals
between the combs. But this expedient is in preparation
for a season when it is important to have copious magazines,
and when, their activity being relaxed, it is unnecessary for
their communications to be so spacious and free. On the
return of spring, the bees hasten to contract the elongated
cells, that they may become fit for receiving the eggs which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the queen is about to deposit, and in this manner they re-establish
the regular distance.<a name="FNanchor_AS" id="FNanchor_AS"></a><a href="#Footnote_AS" class="fnanchor">[AS]</a></p>

<p>We are indebted to the late Dr. Barclay of Edinburgh,
well known as an excellent anatomist, for the discovery that
each cell in a honeycomb is not simply composed of one wall,
but consists of two. We shall give the account of his
discovery in his own words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Having inquired of several naturalists whether or not
they knew any author who had mentioned that the partitions
between the cells of the honeycomb were double, and whether
or not they had ever remarked such a structure themselves,
and they having answered in the negative, I now take the
liberty of presenting to the Society pieces of honeycomb, in
which the young bees had been reared, upon breaking which,
it will be clearly seen that the partitions between different
cells, at the sides and the base, are all <i>double</i>; or, in other
words, that each cell is a distinct, separate, and in some
measure an independent structure, agglutinated only to the
neighbouring cells; and that when the agglutinating substance
is destroyed, each cell may be entirely separated from
the rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have also some specimens of the cells formed by wasps,
which show that the partitions between them are also double,
and that the agglutinating substance between them is more
easily destroyed than that between the cells of the bee.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_AT" id="FNanchor_AT"></a><a href="#Footnote_AT" class="fnanchor">[AT]</a></p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Irregularities in their Workmanship.</p>

<p>Though bees, however, work with great uniformity when
circumstances favour their operations, they may be compelled
to vary their proceedings. M. Huber made several
ingenious experiments of this kind. The following, mentioned
by Dr. Bevan, was accidental, and occurred to his
friend Mr. Walond. "Inspecting his bee-boxes at the end
of October, 1817, he perceived that a centre comb, burthened
with honey, had separated from its attachments, and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
leaning against another comb so as to prevent the passage
of the bees between them. This accident excited great
activity in the colony; but its nature could not be ascertained
at the time. At the end of a week, the weather
being cold, and the bees clustered together Mr. Walond
observed, through the window of the box, that they had
constructed two horizontal pillars betwixt the combs alluded
to, and had removed so much of the honey and wax from
the top of each as to allow the passage of a bee: in about
ten days more there was an uninterrupted thoroughfare; the
detached comb at its upper part had been secured by a
strong barrier, and fastened to the window with the spare
wax. This being accomplished, the bees removed the horizontal
pillars first constructed, as being of no further use."<a name="FNanchor_AU" id="FNanchor_AU"></a><a href="#Footnote_AU" class="fnanchor">[AU]</a></p>

<p>A similar anecdote is told by M. Huber. &ldquo;During the
winter,&rdquo; says he, "a comb in one of my bell-glass hives,
having been originally insecure, fell down, but preserved its
position parallel to the rest. The bees were unable to fill
up the vacuity left above it, because they do not build combs
of old wax, and none new could be then obtained. At a
more favourable season they would have engrafted a new
comb on the old one; but now their provision of honey could
not be spared for the elaboration of this substance, which
induced them to insure the stability of the comb by another
process.</p>

<p>"Crowds of bees taking wax from the lower part of other
combs, and even gnawing it from the surface of the orifices
of the deepest cells, they constructed so many irregular
pillars, joists, or buttresses, between the sides of the fallen
comb, and others on the glass of the hive. All these were
artificially adapted to localities. Neither did they confine
themselves to repairing the accidents which their works had
sustained. They seemed to profit by the warning to guard
against a similar casualty.</p>

<p>"The remaining combs were not displaced; therefore,
while solidly adhering by the base, we were greatly surprised
to see the bees strengthen their principal fixtures with old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
wax. They rendered them much thicker than before, and
fabricated a number of new connections, to unite them more
firmly to each other and to the sides of their dwelling. All
this passed in the middle of January, a time that these
insects commonly keep in the upper part of their hive, and
when work is no longer seasonable."<a name="FNanchor_AV" id="FNanchor_AV"></a><a href="#Footnote_AV" class="fnanchor">[AV]</a></p>

<p>M. Huber the younger shrewdly remarks, that the tendency
to symmetry observable in the architecture of bees does
not hold so much in small details as in the whole work,
because they are sometimes obliged to adapt themselves to
particular localities. One irregularity leads on to another,
and it commonly arises from mere accident, or from design
on the part of the proprietor of the bees. By allowing, for
instance, too little interval between the spars for receiving
the foundation of the combs, the structure has been continued
in a particular direction. The bees did not at first appear to
be sensible of the defect, though they afterwards began to
suspect their error, and were then observed to change their
line of work till they gained the customary distance. The
cells having been by this change of direction in some degree
curved, the new ones which were commenced on each side of
it, by being built everywhere parallel to it, partook of the
same curvature. But the bees did not relish such approaches
to the &ldquo;line of beauty,&rdquo; and exerted themselves to bring their
buildings again into the regular form.</p>

<p>In consequence of several irregularities which they wished
to correct, the younger Huber has seen bees depart from
their usual practice, and at once lay on a spar two foundation-walls
not in the same line. They could consequently neither
be enlarged without obstructing both, nor from their position
could the edges unite, had they been prolonged. The little
architects, however, had recourse to a very ingenious contrivance:
they curved the edges of the two combs, and
brought them to unite so neatly that they could be both
prolonged in the same line with ease; and when carried to
some little distance, their surface became quite uniform and
level.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Having seen bees,&rdquo; says the elder Huber, "work both
up and down, I wished to try to investigate whether we could
compel them to construct their combs in any other direction.
We endeavoured to puzzle them with a hive glazed above
and below, so that they had no place of support but the
upright sides of their dwelling; but, betaking themselves to
the upper angle, they built combs perpendicular to one of
these sides, and as regularly as those which they usually
build under a horizontal surface. The foundations were laid
on a place which does not serve naturally for the base, yet,
except in the difference of direction, the first row of cells
resembled those in ordinary hives, the others being distributed
on both faces, while the bottoms alternately corresponded
with the same symmetry. I put the bees to a still
greater trial. As they now testified their inclination to
carry their combs, by the shortest way, to the opposite side
of the hive (for they prefer uniting them to wood, or a
surface rougher than glass), I covered it with a pane.
Whenever this smooth and slippery substance was interposed
between them and the wood, they departed from the straight
line hitherto followed, and bent the structure of their comb
at a right angle to what was already made, so that the prolongation
of the extremity might reach another side of the
hive, which had been left free.</p>

<p>"Varying this experiment in several ways, I saw the bees
constantly change the direction of their combs, when I
presented to them a surface too smooth to admit of their
clustering on it. They always sought the wooden sides. I
thus compelled them to curve the combs in the strangest
shapes, by placing a pane at a certain distance from their
edges. These results indicate a degree of instinct truly
wonderful. They denote even more than instinct: for glass
is not a substance against which bees can be warned by
nature. In trees, their natural abode, there is nothing that
resembles it, or with the same polish. The most singular
part of their proceeding is changing the direction of the
work before arriving at the surface of the glass, and while
yet at a distance suitable for doing so. Do they anticipate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the inconvenience which would attend any other mode of
building? No less curious is the plan adopted by the bee
for producing an angle in the combs: the wonted fashion of
their work, and the dimensions of the cells, must be altered.
Therefore, the cells on the upper or convex side of the
combs are enlarged; they are constructed of three or four
times the width of those on the opposite surface. How can
so many insects, occupied at once on the edges of the combs,
concur in giving them a common curvature from one extremity
to the other? How do they resolve on establishing cells so
small on one side, while dimensions so enlarged are bestowed
on those of the other? And is it not still more singular,
that they have the art of making a correspondence between
cells of such reciprocal discrepance? The bottom being
common to both, the tubes alone assume a taper form.
Perhaps no other insect has afforded a more decisive proof of
the resources of instinct, when compelled to deviate from the
ordinary course.</p>

<p>"But let us study them in their natural state, and there
we shall find that the diameter of their cells must be adapted
to the individuals which shall be bred in them. The cells
of males have the same figure, the same number of lozenges
and sides, as those of workers, and angles of the same size.
Their diameter is 3-1/3 lines, while those of workers are
only 2-2/5.</p>

<p>"It is rarely that the cells of males occupy the higher
part of the combs. They are generally in the middle or on
the sides, where they are not isolated. The manner in
which they are surrounded by other cells alone can explain
how the transition in size is effected. When the cells of
males are to be fabricated under those of workers, the bees
make several rows of intermediate cells, whose diameter
augments progressively, until gaining that proportion proper
to the cells required; and in returning to those of workers,
a lowering is observed in a manner corresponding.</p>

<p>"Bees, in preparing the cells of males, previously establish
a block or lump of wax on the edge of their comb,
thicker than is usually employed for those of workers. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
also made higher, otherwise the same order and symmetry
could not be preserved on a larger scale.</p>

<p>"Several naturalists notice the irregularities in the cells
of bees as so many defects. What would have been their
astonishment had they observed that part of them are the
result of calculation? Had they followed the imperfection
of their organs, some other means of compensating them
would have been granted to the insects. It is much more
surprising that they know how to quit the ordinary route,
when circumstances demand the construction of enlarged
cells; and, after building thirty or forty rows of them, to
return to the proper proportions from which they have
departed by successive reductions. Bees also augment the
dimensions of their cells when there is an opportunity for
a great collection of honey. Not only are they then constructed
of a diameter much exceeding that of the common
cells, but they are elongated throughout the whole space
admitting it. A great portion of irregular comb contains
cells an inch, or even an inch and a half, in depth.</p>

<p>"Bees, on the contrary, sometimes are induced to shorten
their cells. When wishing to prolong an old comb, whose
cells have received their full dimensions, they gradually
reduce the thickness of its edges, by gnawing down the
sides of the cells, until they restore it to its original lenticular
form. They add a waxen block around the whole
circumference, and on the edge of the comb construct pyramidal
bottoms, such as those fabricated on ordinary occasions.
It is a certain fact, that a comb never is extended in
any direction unless the bees have thinned the edges, which
are diminished throughout a sufficient space to remove any
angular projection.</p>

<p>"The law which obliges these insects partly to demolish
the cells on the edges of the comb before enlarging it, unquestionably
demands more profound investigation. How
can we account for instinct leading them to undo what they
have executed with the utmost care? The wonted regular
gradation which may be necessary for new cells, subsists
among those adjoining the edges of a comb recently constructed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
But afterwards, when those on the edge are
deepened like the cells of the rest of the surface, the bees
no longer preserve the decreasing gradation which is seen in
the new combs."<a name="FNanchor_AW" id="FNanchor_AW"></a><a href="#Footnote_AW" class="fnanchor">[AW]</a></p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">The Finishing of the Cells.</p>

<p>While the cells are building they appear to be of a dull
white colour, soft, even, though not smooth, and translucent;
but in a few days they become tinged with yellow, particularly
on the interior surface; and their edges, from being
thin, uniform, and yielding, become thicker, less regular,
more heavy, and so firm that they will bend rather than
break. New combs break on the slightest touch. There
is also a glutinous substance observable around the orifices
of the yellow cells, of reddish colour, unctuous, and odoriferous.
Threads of the same substance are applied all around
the interior of the cells, and at the summit of their angles,
as if it were for the purpose of binding and strengthening
the walls. These yellow cells also require a much higher
temperature of water to melt them than the white ones.</p>

<p>It appeared evident, therefore, that another substance,
different from wax, had been employed in varnishing the
orifices, and strengthening the interior of the cells. M.
Huber, by numerous experiments, ascertained the resinous
threads lining the cells, as well as the resinous substance
around their orifice, to be propolis; for he traced them, as
we mentioned in our account of propolis, from the poplar buds
where they collected it, and saw them apply it to the cells;
but the yellow colour is not imparted by propolis, to which
it bears no analogy. We are, indeed, by no means certain
what it is, though it was proved by experiment not to arise
from the heat of the hives, nor from emanations of honey,
nor from particles of pollen. Perhaps it may be ascribed to
the bees rubbing their teeth, feet, and other parts of their
body, on the surfaces where they seem to rest; or to their
tongue (haustellum) sweeping from right to left like a fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
pliant pencil, when it appears to leave some sprinkling of a
transparent liquid.</p>

<p>Besides painting and varnishing their cells in this manner,
they take care to strengthen the weaker part of their edifice
by means of a mortar composed of propolis and wax, and
named <i>pissoceros</i><a name="FNanchor_AX" id="FNanchor_AX"></a><a href="#Footnote_AX" class="fnanchor">[AX]</a> by the ancients who first observed it,
though Réaumur was somewhat doubtful respecting the existence
of such a composition. We are indebted to the
shrewd observations of Huber for a reconcilement of the
Roman and the French naturalists. The details which he
has given of his discovery are perhaps the most interesting
in his delightful book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon,&rdquo; he says, "after some new combs had been finished
in a hive, manifest disorder and agitation prevailed among the
bees. They seemed to attack their own works. The primitive
cells, whose structure we had admired, were scarcely
recognizable. Thick and massive walls, heavy, shapeless
pillars, were substituted for the slight partitions previously
built with such regularity. The substance had changed
along with the form, being composed apparently of wax
and propolis. From the perseverance of the workers in
their devastation, we suspected that they proposed some
useful alteration of their edifices; and our attention was
directed to the cells least injured. Several were yet untouched;
but the bees soon rushed precipitately on them,
destroyed the tubes, broke down the wax, and threw all
the fragments about. But we remarked that the bottom
of the cells of the first row were spared; neither were the
corresponding parts on both faces of the comb demolished
at the same time. The bees laboured at them alternately,
leaving some of the natural supports, otherwise the comb
would have fallen down, which was not their object: they
wished, on the contrary, to provide it a more solid base, and
to secure its union to the vault of the hive, with a substance
whose adhesive properties infinitely surpassed those of wax.
The propolis employed on this occasion had been deposited
in a mass over a cleft of the hive, and had hardened in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
drying, which probably rendered it more suitable for the
purpose. But the bees experienced some difficulty in making
any impression on it; and we thought, as also had appeared
to M. de Réaumur, that they softened it with the same frothy
matter from the tongue which they use to render wax more
ductile.</p>

<p>"We very distinctly observed the bees mixing fragments
of old wax with the propolis, kneading the two substances
together to incorporate them; and the compound was employed
in rebuilding the cells that had been destroyed. But
they did not now follow their ordinary rules of architecture,
for they were occupied by the solidity of their edifices alone.
Night intervening, suspended our observations, but next
morning confirmed what we had seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We find, therefore, that there is an epoch in the labour
of bees, when the upper foundation of their combs is constructed
simply of wax, as Réaumur believed; and that, after
all the requisite conditions have been attained, it is converted
to a mixture of wax and propolis, as remarked by Pliny so
many ages before us. Thus is the apparent contradiction
between these two great naturalists explained. But this is
not the utmost extent of the foresight of these insects.
When they have plenty of wax, they make their combs the
full breadth of the hive, and solder them to the glass or
wooden sides, by structures more or less approaching the
form of cells, as circumstances admit. But should the supply
of wax fail before they have been able to give sufficient
diameter to the combs whose edges are rounded, large intervals
remain between them and the upright sides of the hive,
and they are fixed only at the top. Therefore, did not the
bees provide against it, by constructing great pieces of wax
mixed with propolis, in the intervals, they might be borne
down by the weight of the honey. These pieces are of
irregular shape, strangely hollowed out, and their cavities
void of symmetry.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_AY" id="FNanchor_AY"></a><a href="#Footnote_AY" class="fnanchor">[AY]</a></p>

<p>It is remarked by the lively Abbé la Pluche, that the
foundations of our houses sink with the earth on which they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
are built, the walls begin to stoop by degrees, they nod with
age, and bend from their perpendicular;&mdash;lodgers damage
everything, and time is continually introducing some new
decay. The mansions of the bees, on the contrary, grow
stronger the oftener they change inhabitants. Every bee-grub,
before its metamorphosis into a nymph, fastens its skin
to the partitions of its cell, but in such a manner as to make
it correspond with the lines of the angle, and without in the
least disturbing the regularity of the figure. During summer,
accordingly, the same lodging may serve for three or
four grubs in succession; and in the ensuing season it may
accommodate an equal number. Each grub never fails to
fortify the panels of its chamber by arraying them with its
spoils, and the contiguous cells receive a similar augmentation
from its brethren.<a name="FNanchor_AZ" id="FNanchor_AZ"></a><a href="#Footnote_AZ" class="fnanchor">[AZ]</a> Réaumur found as many as seven
or eight of these skins spread over one another: so that all
the cells being incrusted with six or seven coverings, well
dried and cemented with propolis, the whole fabric daily
acquires a new degree of solidity.</p>

<p>It is obvious, however, that by a repetition of this process
the cell might be rendered too contracted; but in such a
case the bees know well how to proceed, by turning the cells
to other uses, such as magazines for bee-bread and honey.
It has been remarked, however, that in the hive of a new
swarm, during the months of July and August, there are
fewer small bees or nurse-bees than in one that has been
tenanted four or five years. The workers, indeed, clean out
the cell the moment that a young bee leaves its cocoon, but
they never detach the silky film which it has previously spun
on the walls of its cell. But though honey is deposited after
the young leave the cells, the reverse also happens; and
accordingly, when bees are bred in contracted cells, they
are by necessity smaller, and constitute, in fact, the important
class of nurse-bees.</p>

<p>We are not disposed, however, to go quite so far as an
American periodical writer, who says, "Thus we see that
the contraction of the cell may diminish the size of a bee,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
<i>even to the extinction of life</i>, just as the contraction of a Chinese
shoe reduces the foot even to uselessness."<a name="FNanchor_BA" id="FNanchor_BA"></a><a href="#Footnote_BA" class="fnanchor">[BA]</a> We know, on
the contrary, that the queen-bee will not deposit eggs in a
cell either too small or too large for the proper rearing of
the young. In the case of large cells, M. Huber took advantage
of a queen that was busy depositing the eggs of
workers to remove all the common cells adapted for their
reception, and left only the larger cells appropriated for
males. As this was done in June, when bees are most
active, he expected that they would have immediately repaired
the breaches he had made; but to his great surprise
they did not make the slightest movement for that purpose.
In the meanwhile the queen, being oppressed by her eggs,
was obliged to drop them about at random, preferring this to
depositing them in the male cells, which she knew to be too
large. At length she did deposit six eggs in the large cells,
which were hatched as usual three days after. The nurse-bees,
however, seemed to be aware that they could not be
reared there, and though they supplied them with food, did
not attend to them regularly. M. Huber found that they
had been all removed from the cells during the night, and
the business both of laying and nursing was at a complete
stand for twelve days, when he supplied them again with a
comb of small cells, which the queen almost immediately
filled with eggs, and in some cells she laid five or six.</p>

</div>

<p>[The accompanying illustration exhibits these three kinds
of bees, namely, the Queen, the Drone, and the Worker,
together with the cells which they respectively inhabit.
Fig. 1 shows the queen-bee as she appears when in command
of a hive. When she first issues from the royal cell,
she is much smaller in the body, and an inexperienced
observer might have some difficulty in distinguishing her
from an ordinary worker. But any one who has been accustomed
to bees can pick her out as soon as his eyes rest
upon her. Her body is rather larger and narrower than
those of the workers, and the wings are shorter in proportion,
slightly crossing at the tips when she is at rest. Fig. 2
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
represents the common worker-bee, which, as has already
been mentioned, is simply an undeveloped female. Fig. 3
is the male or drone-bee, which is easily distinguishable,
even by a novice. He is larger, stouter, and heavier built
than the female; his eyes are so enormous that they seem
to occupy nearly the entire head, and he has some well-defined
tufts of hair on the end of the abdomen. He can
even be detected by the ear, as he flies, the deep droning hum
being quite unlike the fussy, business-like sound produced by
the worker. Fig. 4 represents one of the royal cells, a little
reduced in size. In making this cell, the bees lose sight of
their habitual economy of wax, and use enough material for
fifty ordinary cells. It is probable that the great size of
the cell enables the inclosed insect to expand, and so to be
capable of becoming the mother as well as the ruler of her
subjects. The royal cell is always placed at the edge of a
comb, so as not to interfere with the other cells, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
contain honey, bee-bread, and grubs; and in each hive there
are generally several of these cells in different stages of
structure. Figs. 5 and 6 represent the proportionate sizes
of the cells which contain the drone and worker bees.]</p>

<p class="tb_stars">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>The architecture of the hive, which we have thus detailed,
is that of bees receiving the aid of human care, and having
external coverings of a convenient form, prepared for their
reception. In this country bees are not found in a wild
state; though it is not uncommon for swarms to stray from
their proprietors. But these stray swarms do not spread
colonies through our woods, as they are said to do in
America. In the remoter parts of that continent there
are no wild bees. They precede civilization; and thus
when the Indians observe a swarm they say, &ldquo;The white
man is coming.&rdquo; There is evidence of bees having abounded
in these islands, in the earlier periods of our history; and
Ireland is particularly mentioned by the Venerable Bede as
being &ldquo;rich in milk and honey.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_BB" id="FNanchor_BB"></a><a href="#Footnote_BB" class="fnanchor">[BB]</a> The hive-bee has formed
an object of economical culture in Europe at least for two
thousand years; and Varro describes the sort of hives used
in his time, 1870 years ago. We are not aware, however,
that it is now to be found wild in the milder clime of
Southern Europe, any more than it is in our own island.</p>

<p>The wild bees of Palestine principally hived in rocks.
&ldquo;He made him,&rdquo; says Moses, &ldquo;to suck honey out of the
rock.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_BC" id="FNanchor_BC"></a><a href="#Footnote_BC" class="fnanchor">[BC]</a> &ldquo;With honey out of the rock,&rdquo; says the Psalmist,
&ldquo;should I have satisfied thee.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_BD" id="FNanchor_BD"></a><a href="#Footnote_BD" class="fnanchor">[BD]</a> In the caves of Salsette
and Elephanta, at the present day, they hive in the clefts
of the rocks, and the recesses among the fissures, in such
numbers as to become very troublesome to visitors. Their
nests hang in innumerable clusters.<a name="FNanchor_BE" id="FNanchor_BE"></a><a href="#Footnote_BE" class="fnanchor">[BE]</a></p>

<p>We are told of a little black stingless bee found in the
island of Guadaloupe, which hives in hollow trees or in
the cavities of rocks by the sea-side, and lays "up honey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
in cells about the size and shape of pigeons&rsquo; eggs. These
cells are of a black or deep-violet colour, and so joined
together as to leave no space between them. They hang
in clusters almost like a bunch of grapes."<a name="FNanchor_BF" id="FNanchor_BF"></a><a href="#Footnote_BF" class="fnanchor">[BF]</a> The following
are mentioned by Lindley as indigenous to Brazil. &ldquo;On an
excursion towards Upper Tapagippe,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and skirting
the dreary woods which extend to the interior, I observed
the trees more loaded with bees&rsquo; nests than even in the
neighbourhood of Porto Seguro. They consist of a ponderous
shell of clay, cemented similarly to martins&rsquo; nests,
swelling from high trees about a foot thick, and forming an
oval mass full two feet in diameter. When broken, the wax
is arranged as in our hives, and the honey abundant.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_BG" id="FNanchor_BG"></a><a href="#Footnote_BG" class="fnanchor">[BG]</a></p>

<p>Captain Basil Hall found in South America the hive of a
honey-bee very different from the Brazilian, but nearly
allied to, if not the same as, that of Guadaloupe. &ldquo;The
hive we saw opened,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;was only partly filled,
which enabled us to see the economy of the interior to
more advantage. The honey is not contained in the elegant
hexagonal cells of our hives, but in wax bags, not quite so
large as an egg. These bags or bladders are hung round
the sides of the hive, and appear about half full; the
quantity being probably just as great as the strength of
the wax will bear without tearing. Those near the bottom,
being better supported, are more filled than the upper ones.
In the centre of the lower part of the hive we observed an
irregularly-shaped mass of comb, furnished with cells like
those of our bees, all containing young ones in such an advanced
state, that, when we broke the comb, and let them
out, they flew merrily away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clavigero, in his &lsquo;History of Mexico,&rsquo; evidently describing
the same species of bee, says it abounds in Yucatan, and
makes the honey of Estabentum, the finest in the world, and
which is taken every two months. He mentioned another
species of bee, smaller in size, and also without a sting,
which forms its nest of the shape of a sugar-loaf, and as large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
or larger. These are suspended from trees, particularly from
the oak, and are much more populous than our common
hives.</p>

<p>Wild honey-bees of some species appear also to abound in
Africa. Mr. Park, in his second volume of travels, tells us
that some of his associates imprudently attempted to rob a
numerous hive of its honey, when the exasperated bees,
rushing out to defend their property, attacked their assailants
with great fury, and quickly compelled the whole company
to fly.</p>

<p>At the Cape of Good Hope the bees themselves must be
less formidable, or more easily managed, as their hives are
sought for with avidity. Nature has there provided man
with a singular and very efficient assistant in a bird, most appropriately
named the honey-guide (<i>Indicator major</i>, <span class="smcap">Veillot</span>;
<i>Cuculus indicator</i>, <span class="smcap">Latham</span>). The honey-guide, it is said, so
far from being alarmed at the presence of man, appears
anxious to court his acquaintance, and flits from tree to
tree with an expressive note of invitation, the meaning of
which is both well known to the colonists and the Hottentots.
A person thus invited by the honey-guide seldom refuses to
follow it onward till it stops, as it is certain to do, at some
hollow tree containing a bee-hive, usually well stored with
honey and wax. It may be that the bird finds itself inadequate
to the attack of a legion of bees, or to penetrate
into the interior of the hive, and is thence led to invite an
agent more powerful than itself. The person invited, indeed,
always leaves the bird a share of the spoil, as it would be
considered sacrilege to rob it of its due, or in any way to
injure so sacred a bird.</p>

<p>Useful, however, as is the honey-guide, it must always be
carefully watched, and the traveller must not follow it without
keeping his eyes well open. For although, as a general
fact, the bird will lead its followers to honey, it has a strange
habit of leading them to the spot where lies hidden some
dangerous animal. Sometimes it brings them to a rhinoceros,
wallowing in a mud pool. Sometimes it directs them to a
solitary buffalo, one of the most dangerous animals that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Southern Africa produces, and one which the natives fear
but little less than the lion itself. And more than once the
too-confiding traveller has followed the honey-guide, and
been led to a spot where was lying one of the venomous
serpents.</p>

<p>The Americans, who have not the African honey-guide,
employ several well-known methods to track bees to their
hives. One of the most common though ingenious modes
is to place a piece of bee-bread on a flat surface, a tile for
instance, surrounding it with a circle of wet white paint.
The bee, whose habit it is always to alight on the edge of
any plane, has to travel through the paint to reach the bee-bread.
When, therefore, she flies off, the observer can track
her by the white on her body. The same operation is
repeated at another place, at some distance from the first,
and at right angles to the bee-line just ascertained. The
position of the hive is easily determined, for it lies in the
angle made by the intersection of the bee-lines. Another
method is described in the &lsquo;Philosophical Transactions for
1721.&rsquo; The bee-hunter decoys, by a bait of honey, some of
the bees into his trap, and when he has secured as many as
he judges will suit his purpose, he encloses one in a tube,
and, letting it fly, marks its course by a pocket-compass.
Departing to some distance, he liberates another, observes
its course, and in this manner determines the position of the
hive, upon the principle already detailed. These methods
of bee-hunting depend upon the insect&rsquo;s habit of always
flying in a right line to its home. Those who have read
Cooper&rsquo;s tale of the &lsquo;Prairie&rsquo; must well remember the
character of the bee-hunter, and the expression of &ldquo;lining a
bee to its hive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In reading these and similar accounts of the bees of
distant parts of the world, we must not conclude that the
descriptions refer to the same species as the common honey-bee.
There are numerous species of social bees, which, while
they differ in many circumstances, agree in the practice of
storing up honey, in the same way as we have numerous
species of the mason-bee and of the humble-bee.</p>

<p class="caption2">CARPENTRY OF TREE-HOPPERS AND SAW-FLIES.</p>


<p>The operations of an insect in boring into a leaf or a bud to
form a lodgment for its eggs appear very simple. The
tools, however, by which these effects are performed are very
complicated and curious. In the case of gall-flies (<i>Cynips</i>),
the operation itself is not so remarkable as its subsequent
chemical effects. These effects are so different from any
others that may be classed under the head of Insect Architecture,
that we shall reserve them for the latter part of this
volume, although, with reference to the use of galls, the
protection of eggs and larvæ, they ought to find a place here.
We shall, however, at present confine ourselves to those
which simply excavate a nest, without producing a tumour.</p>

<p>The first of these insects which we shall mention is
celebrated for its song, by the ancient Greek poets, under the
name of <i>Tettix</i>. The Romans called it <i>Cicada</i>, which we
sometimes, but erroneously, translate &ldquo;grasshopper;&rdquo; for
the grasshoppers belong to an entirely different order of
insects. We shall, therefore, take the liberty of calling the
Cicadæ <i>Tree-hoppers</i>, to which the cuckoo-spit insect (<i>Tettigonia
spumaria</i>, <span class="smcap">Oliv.</span>) is allied; but there is only one of the
true Cicadæ hitherto ascertained to be British, namely, the
<i>Cicada hæmatodes</i> (<span class="smcap">Linn.</span>), which was discovered in the New
Forest, Hampshire, by Mr. Daniel Bydder.</p>

<p>M. Réaumur was exceedingly anxious to study the economy
of these insects; but they not being indigenous in the neighbourhood
of Paris, he commissioned his friends to send him
some from more southern latitudes, and he procured in this
way specimens not only from the South of France and from
Italy, but also from Egypt. From these specimens he has
given the best account of them yet published; for though,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
as he tells us, he had never had the pleasure of seeing one of
them alive, the most interesting parts of their structure can
be studied as well in dead as in living specimens. We ourselves
possess several specimens from New Holland, upon
which we have verified some of the more interesting observations
of Réaumur.</p>

<p>Virgil tells us that in his time &ldquo;the cicadæ burst the
very shrubs with their querulous music;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_BH" id="FNanchor_BH"></a><a href="#Footnote_BH" class="fnanchor">[BH]</a> but we may well
suppose that he was altogether unacquainted with the singular
instrument by means of which they can, not poetically, but
actually, cut grooves in the branches they select for depositing
their eggs. It is the male, as in the case of birds, which
fills the woods with his song; while the female, though mute,
is no less interesting to the naturalist on account of her
curious ovipositor. This instrument, like all those with
which insects are furnished by nature for cutting, notching,
or piercing, is composed of a horny substance, and is also
considerably larger than the size of the tree-hopper would
proportionally indicate. It can on this account be partially
examined without a microscope, being, in some of the larger
species, no less than five lines<a name="FNanchor_BI" id="FNanchor_BI"></a><a href="#Footnote_BI" class="fnanchor">[BI]</a> in length.</p>

<p>The ovipositor, or auger (<i>tarière</i>), as Réaumur calls it, is
lodged in a sheath which lies in a groove of the terminating
ring of the belly. It requires only a very slight pressure to
cause the instrument to protrude from its sheath, when it
appears to the naked eye to be of equal thickness throughout,
except at the point, where it is somewhat enlarged and
angular, and on both sides finely indented with teeth. A
more minute examination of the sheath demonstrates that it
is composed of two horny pieces slightly curved, and ending
in the form of an elongated spoon, the concave part of which
is adapted to receive the convex end of the ovipositor.</p>

<p>When the protruded instrument is further examined with
a microscope, the denticulations, nine in number on each side,
appear strong, and arranged with great symmetry, increasing
in fineness towards the point, where there are three or four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
very small ones, beside the nine that are more obvious. The
magnifier also shows that the instrument itself, which appeared
simple to the naked eye, is, in fact, composed of three different
pieces; two exterior armed with the teeth before mentioned,
denominated by Réaumur files (<i>limes</i>), and another
pointed like a lancet, and not denticulated. The denticulated
pieces, moreover, are capable of being moved forwards and
backwards, while the centre one remains stationary; and as
this motion is effected by pressing a pin or the blade of a
knife over the muscles on either side at the origin of the
ovipositor, it may be presumed that those muscles are destined
for producing similar movements when the insect requires
them. By means of a finely-pointed pin carefully introduced
between the pieces, and pushed very gently downwards, they
may be, with no great difficulty, separated in their whole
extent.</p>

<p>The contrivance by which those three pieces are held
united, while at the same time the two files can be easily put
in motion, is similar to those of our own mechanical inventions,
with this difference, that no human workman could
construct an instrument of this description so small, fine,
exquisitely polished, and fitting so exactly. We should have
been apt to form the grooves in the central piece, whereas
they are scooped out in the handles of the files, and play
upon two projecting ridges in the central piece, by which
means this is rendered stronger. M. Réaumur discovered
that the best manner of showing the play of this extraordinary
instrument is to cut it off with a pair of scissors near
its origin, and then, taking it between the thumb and the
finger at the point of section, work it gently to put the files
in motion.</p>

<p>Beside the muscles necessary for the movement of the
files, the handle of each is terminated by a curve of the same
hard horny substance as itself, which not only furnishes the
muscles with a sort of lever, but serves to press, as with a
spring, the two files close to the central piece, as is shown in
the lower figure.</p>

<p>M. Pontedera, who studied the economy of the tree-hoppers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
with some care, was anxious to see the insect itself make use
of the ovipositor in forming grooves in wood, but found that
it was so shy and easily alarmed, that it took to flight whenever
he approached; a circumstance of which Réaumur takes
advantage, to soothe his regret that the insects were not
indigenous in his neighbourhood. But of their workmanship,
when completed, he had several specimens sent to him from
Provence and Languedoc by the Marquis de Caumont.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Excavations for eggs of Tree-hopper, with the chip-lids raised.</div>
</div>

<p>The gall-flies, when about to deposit their eggs, select
growing plants and trees; but the tree-hoppers, on the contrary,
make choice of dead, dried branches, for the mother
seems to be aware that moisture would injure her progeny.
The branch, commonly a small one, in which eggs have been
deposited, may be recognised by being covered with little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
oblong elevations caused by small splinters of the wood,
detached at one end, but left fixed at the other, by the insect.
These elevations are for the most part in a line, rarely in a
double line, nearly at equal distances from each other, and
form a lid to a cavity in the wood about four lines in length,
containing from four to ten eggs. It is to be remarked that
the insect always selects a branch of such dimensions that it
can get at the pith, not because the pith is more easily bored,
for it does not penetrate into it all, but to form a warm and
safe bed for the eggs. M. Pontedera says, that when the
eggs have been deposited, the insect closes the mouth of the
hole with a gum capable of protecting them from the weather;
but M. Réaumur thinks this only a fancy, as, out of a great
number which he examined, he could discover nothing of the
kind. Neither is such a protection wanted; for the woody
splinters above mentioned furnish a very good covering.</p>

<p>The grubs hatch from these eggs (of which, M. Pontedera
says, one female will deposit from five to seven hundred),
issue from the same holes through which the eggs have been
introduced, and betake themselves to the ground to feed on
the roots of plants. They are not transformed into chrysalides,
but into active nymphs, remarkable for their fore limbs,
which are thick, strong, and furnished with prongs for digging;
and when we are told, by Dr. Le Ferve, that they
make their way easily into hard stiff clay, to the depth of two
or three feet, we perceive how necessary to them such a conformation
must be.</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Saw-flies.</p>

<p>An instrument for cutting grooves in wood, still more
ingeniously contrived than that of the tree-hopper, was first
observed by Vallisnieri, an eminent Italian naturalist, in a
four-winged fly, most appropriately denominated by M. Réaumur
the <i>saw-fly</i> (<i>Tenthredo</i>) of which many sorts are indigenous
to Great Britain. The grubs from which these flies
originate are indeed but too well known, as they frequently
strip our rose, gooseberry, raspberry, and red currant trees of
their leaves, and are no less destructive to birch, alder, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
willows; while turnips and wheat suffer still more seriously
by their ravages. These grubs may readily be distinguished
from the caterpillars of moths and butterflies by having from
sixteen to twenty-eight feet, by which they usually hang to
the leaf they feed on, while they coil up the hinder part of
their body in a spiral ring. The perfect flies are distinguished
by four transparent wings; and some of the most
common have a flat body of a yellow or orange colour, while
the head and shoulders are black.</p>

<p>In order to see the ovipositor, to which we shall for the
present turn our chief attention, a female saw-fly must be
taken, and her belly gently pressed, when a narrow slit will
be observed to open at some distance from the apex, and a
short, pointed, and somewhat curved body, of a brown colour
and horny substance, will be protruded. The curved plates
which form the sides of the slit are the termination of the
sheath, in which the instrument lies concealed till it is
wanted by the insect. The appearance of this instrument,
however, and its singular structure, cannot be well understood
without the aid of a microscope.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 140px;">

<div class="fig_caption"><i>a</i>, Ovipositor of Saw-fly, protruded from its sheath, magnified.</div>
</div>

<p>The instrument thus brought into view is a very finely-contrived
saw, made of a horny substance, and adapted for
penetrating branches and other parts of plants where the
eggs are to be deposited. The ovipositor-saw of the insect
is much more complicated than any of those employed by our
carpenters. The teeth of our saws are formed in a line, but
in such a manner as to cut in two lines parallel to, and at a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
small distance from, each other. This is effected by slightly
bending the points of the alternate teeth right and left, so
that one-half of the whole teeth stand a little to the right,
and the other half a little to the left. The distance of the
two parallel lines thus formed is called the <i>course</i> of the saw,
and it is only the portion of wood which lies in the course
that is cut into sawdust by the action of the instrument. It
will follow that in proportion to the thinness of a saw there
will be the less destruction of wood which may be sawed.
When cabinet-makers have to divide valuable wood into very
thin leaves, they accordingly employ saws with a narrow
course, while sawyers who cut planks use one with a broad
course. The ovipositor-saw being extremely fine, does not
require the teeth to diverge much; but from the manner in
which they operate, it is requisite that they should not stand,
like those of our saws, in a straight line. The greater
portion of the edge of the instrument, on the contrary, is
towards the point somewhat concave, similar to a scythe,
while towards the base it becomes a little convex, the whole
edge being nearly the shape of an Italic <i>f</i>.</p>

<img src="images/170.png" width="225" height="291" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Ovipositor-saw of Saw-fly, with rasps shown in the cross lines.</div>
</div>

<p>The ovipositor-saw of the fly is put in motion in the same
way as a carpenter&rsquo;s hand-saw, supposing the tendons attached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
to its base to form the handle, and the muscles which put it
in motion to be the hand of the carpenter. But the carpenter
can only work one saw at a time, whereas each of these flies
is furnished with two, equal and similar, which it works at
the same time&mdash;one being advanced and the other retracted
alternately. The secret, indeed, of working more saws than
one at once is not unknown to our mechanics; for two or
three are sometimes fixed in the same frame. These, however,
not only all move upwards and downwards simultaneously,
but cut the wood in different places; while the two
saws of the ovipositor work in the same cut, and consequently,
though the teeth are extremely fine, the effect is similar to a
saw with a wide set.</p>

<p>It is important, seeing that the ovipositor-saws are so fine,
that they be not bent or separated while in operation&mdash;and
this, also, nature has provided for, by lodging the backs of
the saws in a groove, formed by two membranous plates,
similar to the structure of a clasp-knife. These plates are
thickest at the base, becoming gradually thinner as they
approach the point, which the form of the saws requires.
According to Vallisnieri, it is not the only use of this
apparatus to form a back for the saws, he having discovered,
between the component membranes, two canals, which he
supposes are employed to conduct the eggs of the insect into
the grooves which it has hollowed out for them.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 270px;">
<img src="images/171.png" width="270" height="106" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Portion of a Saw-Fly&rsquo;s comb-toothed rasp, and saw.</div>
</div>

<p>The teeth of a carpenter&rsquo;s saw, it may be remarked, are
simple, whereas the teeth of the ovipositor-saw are themselves
denticulated with fine teeth. The latter, also, combines at
the same time the properties of a saw and of a rasp or file.
So far as we are aware, these two properties have, never been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
combined in any of the tools of our carpenters. The rasping
part of the ovipositor, however, is not constructed like our
rasps, with short teeth thickly studded together, but has
teeth almost as long as those of the saw, and placed contiguous
to them, on the back of the instrument, resembling
in their form and setting the teeth of a comb, as may be seen
in the figure. Of course, such observations are conducted
with the aid of a microscope.</p>

<p>When a female saw-fly has selected the branch of a rose-tree,
or any other, in which to deposit her eggs, she may be
seen bending the end of her belly inwards, in form of a
crescent, and protruding her saw, at the same time, to penetrate
the bark or wood. She maintains this recurved position
so long as she works in deepening the groove; but when she
has attained the depth required, she unbends her body into a
straight line, and in this position works upon the place
lengthways, by applying the saw more horizontally. When
she has rendered the groove as large as she wishes, the
motion of the tendons ceases, and an egg is placed in the
cavity. The saw is then withdrawn into the sheath for
about two-thirds of its length, and at the same moment a
sort of frothy liquid, similar to a lather made with soap, is
dropped over the egg, either for the purpose of gluing it in
its place or sheathing it from the action of the juices of the
tree. She proceeds in the same manner in sawing out a
second groove, and so on in succession, till she has deposited
all her eggs, sometimes to the number of twenty-four. The
grooves are usually placed in a line, at a small distance from
one another, on the same branch; but sometimes the mother-fly
shifts to another, or to a different part of the branch,
when she is either scared or finds it unsuitable. She commonly,
also, takes more than one day to the work, notwithstanding
the superiority of her tools. Réaumur has seen a
saw-fly make six grooves in succession, which occupied her
about ten hours and a half.</p>

<p>The grooves, when finished, have externally little elevation
above the level of the bark, appearing like the puncture of a
lancet in the human skin; but in the course of a day or two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the part becomes first brown and then black, while it also
becomes more and more elevated. This increased elevation
is not owing to the growth of the bark, the fibres of which,
indeed, have been destroyed by the ovipositor-saw, but to the
actual growth of the egg; for when a new-laid egg of the
saw-fly is compared with one which has been several days
enclosed in the groove, the latter will be found to be very
considerably the larger. This growth of the egg is contrary
to the analogy observable in the eggs of birds, and even of
most other insects; but it has its advantages. As it continues
to increase, it raises the bark more and more, and
consequently widens, at the same time, the slit at the
entrance; so that, when the grub is hatched, it finds a
passage ready for its exit. The mother-fly seems to be
aware of this growth of her eggs, for she takes care to deposit
them at such distances as may prevent their disturbing one
another by their development.</p>

<p>Another species of saw-fly, with a yellow body and deep
violet-coloured wings, which also selects the rose-tree,
deposits her eggs in a different manner. Instead of making
a groove for each egg, like the preceding, she forms a large
single groove, sufficient for about two dozen eggs. These
eggs are all arranged in pairs, forming two straight lines
parallel to the sides of the branch. The eggs, however,
though thus deposited in a common groove, are carefully kept
each in its place; for a ridge of the wood is left to prevent
those on the right from touching those on the left&mdash;and not
only so, but between each egg of a row a thin partition of
wood is left, forming a shallow cell.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Nest of eggs of Saw-fly, in rose-tree.</div>

<p>The edges of this groove, it will be obvious, must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
farther apart than those which only contain a single egg,
and, in fact, the whole is open to inspection; but the eggs
are kept from falling out, both by the frothy glue before
mentioned, and by the walls of the cells containing them.
They were observed also, by Vallisnieri, to increase in size
like the preceding.</p>

<p>[In the middle of summer, plenty of these grooves may be
seen, by looking at the under lid of leaf-stalks or delicate
young twigs. Row upon row of the grooves are sometimes
found, so the all-destructive power of the insects must
indeed be great. The larvæ, when full fed, dispose of themselves
in various ways. Those of the gooseberry-fly, for
example (<i>Nematus Ribesii</i>), after they have stripped the bush
of its leaves, either seek the ground or remain on the
branches, and spin a series of cocoons, attaching them to each
branch by their ends. Those, therefore, who wish to destroy
these little pests, must know both localities of the cocoons,
or they will allow one half to escape while destroying the
other.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>This insect has a flat yellow body and four pellucid
wings, the two outer ones marked with brown on the edge.
In April it issues from the pupa, which has lain under
ground from the preceding September. The female of the
gooseberry saw-fly does not, like some of the family, cut a
groove in the branch to deposit her eggs;&mdash;&ldquo;of what use,
then,&rdquo; asks Réaumur, &ldquo;is her ovipositor-saw?&rdquo; In order to
satisfy himself on this point, he introduced a pair of the flies
under a bell-glass along with a branch bent from a red-currant
bush, that he might watch the process. The female
immediately perambulated the leaves in search of a place
suited to her purpose, and passing under a leaf began to lay,
depositing six eggs within a quarter of an hour. Each time
she placed herself as if she wished to cut into the leaf with
her saw; but, upon taking out the leaf, the eggs appeared
rather projecting than lodged in its substance. The caterpillars
are hatched in two or three weeks; and they feed in
company till after midsummer, frequently stripping both the
leaves and fruit of an extensive plantation. The caterpillar
has six legs and sixteen pro-legs, and is of a green colour
mixed with yellow, and covered with minute black dots
raised like shagreen. In its last skin it loses the black dots
and becomes smooth and yellowish white. The Caledonian
Horticultural Society have published a number of plans for
destroying these caterpillars.</p>

<p>[Another remarkable mode of disposing of the pupa is
shown in the accompanying illustration; it represents the
nest of an exotic saw-fly, named <i>Deilocenes Ellisii</i>. In this
instance, the numerous larvæ unite in spinning for themselves
a common envelope of considerable strength; it is
seen as it appears when attached to the branch of a tree.
The material of which it is composed is the tough silken
fibre spun by the larvæ of so many insects, which may be
seen in perfection in the cocoons of the Microgaster. Two
species of this curious group will be described in a future page.</p>

<p>By the side of the branch is seen a diagram of the same
nest, as it would appear in section. The irregularly angular
cells are seen in the centre, and around them is the common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
envelope composed of fibres. As may be seen from the
upper figure, as soon as the insects have attained their perfect
form, they gnaw their way out of the cell and the covering
also. The insect is shown as it appears when flying.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 494px;">
<img src="images/176.png" width="494" height="423" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We will conclude this chapter by a few remarks upon
some exotic insects, whose nests are not only remarkable in
their form, but are valuable to the entomologist in affording
grounds for the reception or rejection of certain familiar
theories upon the subject of this volume&mdash;Insect Architecture.
Several of these nests are of comparatively late discovery, and
are therefore found in this work.</p>

<p>The curious series of cells shown in the left-hand figure
is made by a hymenopterous insect belonging to the genus
Icaria, and the specimens from which the drawing was
taken may be seen in the British Museum. They are made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
of a paper-like substance, much resembling in look the
material of which the common wasp builds its cells, but as
they are exposed to the air, they are necessarily tougher and
stronger than ordinary wasp cells, which are shielded from the
elements. The insects belonging to this genus make nests
of very diverse forms, some of which are stuck on leaves in
a most curious manner, reminding the observer of the
parasitic mollercoids that cover the stems and fronds of large
seaweeds. Others, however, are not dependent upon leaves for
their support, but stand out boldly from the branches to
which they are fixed, supported entirely by a footstalk composed
of the same material as the cells, though necessarily of
a harder and more compact substance.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 485px;">
<img src="images/177.png" width="485" height="403" alt="" />
</div>

<p>As many of these nests have been found in India, it is
easy to trace the manner in which they were made. The
mother insect began by kneading woody fibre into a paste,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
and making the footstalk of the future nest. One end of this
footstalk is attached very strongly to the branch, and to the
other end is fastened the first cell. As soon as the Icaria
has made the first beginning of the cell, and raised&mdash;or rather
lowered&mdash;the walls to a fourth or so of their complete dimensions,
she inserts an egg into the yet imperfect cell, and adds
to the walls while the egg is being hatched. Her next
duty is, to add a second cell, and this is quickly followed by
a third, all these cells being fastened to each other on three
or four of their sides, leaving the others free and unattached.
It is evident that by this mode of construction the cells
nearest the branch must be the longest, because they are
begun the soonest, and this will always be found to be the
case.</p>

<p>Now, there is a point respecting which the attention of
the reader must be specially solicited. On looking at the
cells, he will see that they are partly cylindrical and partly
angular, and may perhaps think that this fact goes towards
proving that the hexagonal shape of bee cells is owing to
mutual pressure, the outer sides of the cells being rounded,
while the inner are angular. But, there are other cells in
existence, built by allied insects, and formed in an analogous
manner, and which are either angular or cylindrical, exactly
according to the instinctive powers of the insect which
built them.</p>

<p>On the right hand of the Icarian nest may be seen a
singular-looking structure pendent at the end of a long footstalk.
This is the nest of an insect called <i>Mischocyttarus
labiatus</i>, one of the Polistidæ. In this case, the cells are
built so as to be defended from the rain by a sort of penthouse,
over which all the rain-drops would run, and so fall
harmless to the ground. The cells of this insect are soft
in texture, and are more cylindrical than angular, the angles
being but very slightly marked.</p>

<p>Here, however, is the nest of an insect called <i>Raphigaster
Guiniensis</i>, which is built in a manner similar to that of the
Icaria, the cells being closely in contact with each other.
The material of which they are made is peculiarly soft.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
something like very thin and flimsy grey paper. Consequently,
they must press strongly upon each other, and we
might reasonably expect to find that their angles are well
and boldly developed. But, instead of that, we find that they
have no angles at all, but remain smooth and rounded
throughout their length.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 158px;">
<img src="images/179a.png" width="158" height="199" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Perhaps the most powerful argument against the equal
pressure theory is to be found in the nest of a species of
Icaria, which is shown in the accompanying illustration.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 186px;">
<img src="images/179b.png" width="186" height="153" alt="" />
</div>

<p>As may be seen by reference to the illustration, the
material of which they are made is so soft, that they bend
over by their own weight, and therefore we might expect to
find that they would follow the shape of the Raphigaster
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
and the Mischocyttarus. But, we find that all the cells are
boldly angular, and that the angles are just as sharp on the
exterior of each cell as on the sides which cement the cells
together. It is clear that the bold lines and decided angles
of these cells cannot have been produced mechanically, and
that they must have been intentionally formed by the
insect architect.</p>

<p>One single cell, such as is here shown, is sufficient to
overthrow the theory of &ldquo;equal pressure,&rdquo; by which insects
were deprived of all mechanical skill, and supposed to labour
like so many animated machines, without caring or knowing
anything about the work on which they were engaged.
According to the equal pressure theory, each of these cells
would have required six similar cells around it before it could
have assumed the hexagonal form, and yet we find that a cell
which is only connected with its neighbour by one side, has
its other five sides angular, and with the angles boldly defined.]</p>

<p class="caption2">LEAF-ROLLING CATERPILLARS.</p>


<p>The labours of those insect-architects, which we have
endeavoured to describe in the preceding pages, have been
chiefly those of mothers to form a secure nest for their eggs,
and the young hatched from them, during the first stage of
their existence. But a much more numerous and not less
ingenious class of architects may be found among the newly-hatched
insects themselves, who, untaught by experience, and
altogether unassisted by previous example, manifest the most
marvellous skill in the construction of tents, houses, galleries,
covert-ways, fortifications, and even cities, not to speak of
subterranean caverns and subaqueous apartments, which no
human art could rival.</p>

<p>The caterpillars, which are familiarly termed leaf-rollers,
are perfect hermits. Each lives in a cell, which it begins to
construct almost immediately after it is hatched; and the
little structure is at once a house which protects the caterpillar
from its enemies, and a store of food for its subsistence,
while it remains shut up in its prison. But the insect
only devours the inner folds. The art which these caterpillars
exercise, although called into action but once, perhaps,
in their lives, is perfect. They accomplish their purpose
with a mechanical skill, which is remarkable for its simplicity
and unerring success. The art of rolling leaves
into a secure and immovable cell may not appear very
difficult: nor would it be so if the caterpillars had fingers,
or any parts which were equivalent to those delicate and
admirable natural instruments with which man accomplishes
his most elaborate works. And yet the human fingers could
not roll a rocket-case of paper more regularly than the
caterpillar rolls his house of leaves. A leaf is not a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
easy substance to roll. In some trees it is very brittle. It
has also a natural elasticity,&mdash;a disposition to spring back if
it be bent,&mdash;which is caused by the continuity of its threads,
or nervures. This elasticity is speedily overcome by the
ingenuity with which the caterpillar works; and the leaf is
thus retained in its artificial position for many weeks, under
every variety of temperature. We will examine, in detail,
how these little leaf-rollers accomplish their task.</p>

<p>One of the most common as well as the most simple fabrics
constructed by caterpillars, may be discovered during summer
on almost every kind of bush and tree. We shall take
as examples those which are found on the lilac and on the
oak.</p>

<p>A small but very pretty chocolate-coloured moth, abundant
in every garden, but not readily seen, from its frequently
alighting on the ground, which is so nearly of its own colour,
deposits its eggs on the leaves of the currant, the lilac, and
of some other trees, appropriating a leaf to each egg. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
soon as the caterpillar is hatched, it begins to secure itself
from birds and predatory insects by rolling up the lilac leaf
into the form of a gallery, where it may feed in safety. We
have repeatedly seen one of them when just escaped from the
egg, and only a few lines long, fix several silk threads from
one edge of a leaf to the other, or from the edge to the mid-rib;
then going to the middle of the space, he shortened
the threads by bending them with his feet, and consequently
pulled the edges of the leaves into a circular form; and he
retained them in that position by gluing down each thread as
he shortened it. In their younger state, those caterpillars
seldom roll more than a small portion of the leaf; but, when
farther advanced, they unite the two edges together in their
whole extent, with the exception of a small opening at one
end, by which an exit may be made in case of need.</p>

<p>Another species of caterpillar, closely allied to this, rolls
up the lilac leaves in a different form, beginning at the end
of a leaf, and fixing and pulling its threads till it gets it
nearly into the shape of a scroll of parchment. To retain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
this form more securely, it is not contented, like the former
insect, with threads fixed on the inside of the leaf; but has
also recourse to a few cables which it weaves on the outside.</p>

<p>Another species of moth, allied to the two preceding, is of
a pretty green colour, and lays its eggs upon the leaves of
the oak. This caterpillar folds them up in a similar manner,
but with this difference, that it works on the under surface
of the leaf, pulling the edge downwards and backwards,
instead of forwards and upwards. This species is very
abundant, and may readily be found as soon as the leaves
expand. In June, when the perfect insect has appeared, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
beating a branch of an oak, a whole shower of these pretty
green moths may be shook into the air.</p>

<p class="tb_stars">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Among the leaf-rolling caterpillars, there is a small dark-brown
one, with a black head and six feet, very common in
gardens, on the currant-bush, or the leaves of the rose-tree
(<i>Lozotænia rosana</i>, <span class="smcap">Stephens</span>). It is exceedingly destructive
to the flower-buds. The eggs are deposited in the summer,
and probably also in the autumn or in spring, in little oval
or circular patches of a green colour. The grub makes its
appearance with the first opening of the leaves, of whose
structure in the half-expanded state it takes advantage to
construct its summer tent. It is not, like some of the other
leaf-rollers, contented with a single leaf, but weaves together
as many as there are in the bud where it may chance to have
been hatched, binding their discs so firmly with silk, that all
the force of the ascending sap, and the increasing growth of
the leaves, cannot break through; a farther expansion is of
course prevented. The little inhabitant in the meanwhile
banquets securely on the partitions of its tent, eating door-ways
from one apartment into another, through which it can
escape in case of danger or disturbance.</p>

<p>The leaflets of the rose, it may be remarked, expand in
nearly the same manner as a fan, and the operations of this
ingenious little insect retain them in the form of a fan nearly
shut. Sometimes, however, it is not contented with one
bundle of leaflets, but by means of its silken cords unites all
which spring from the same bud into a rain-proof canopy,
under the protection of which it can feast on the flower-bud,
and prevent it from ever blowing.</p>

<p>In the instance of the currant-leaves, the proceedings of
the grub are the same; but it cannot unite the plaits so
smoothly as in the case of the rose leaflets, and it requires
more labour, also, as the nervures, being stiff, demand a
greater effort to bend them. When all the exertions of the
insect prove unavailing in its endeavours to draw the edges
of a leaf together, it bends them inwards as far as it can, and
weaves a close web of silk over the open space between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>.
This is well exemplified in one of the commonest of our leaf-rolling
caterpillars, which may be found as early as February
on the leaves of the nettle and the white archangel (<i>Lamium
album</i>). It is of a light dirty-green colour, spotted with
black, and covered with a few hairs. In its young state it
confines itself to the bosom of a small leaf, near the insertion
of the leaf-stalk, partly bending the edges inwards, and
covering in the interval with a silken curtain. As this sort
of covering is not sufficient for concealment when the animal
advances in growth, it abandons the base of the leaf for the
middle, where it doubles up one side in a very secure and
ingenious manner.</p>

</div>

<p>We have watched this little architect begin and finish his
tent upon a nettle in our study, the whole operation taking
more than half an hour. (J. R.) He began by walking
over the plant in all directions, examining the leaves severally,
as if to ascertain which was best fitted for his purpose
by being pliable, and bending with the weight of his body.
Having found one to his mind, he placed himself along the
mid-rib, to the edge of which he secured himself firmly with
the pro-legs of his tail; then stretching his head to the edge
of the leaf, he fixed a series of parallel cables between it and
the mid-rib, with another series crossing these at an acute
angle. The position in which he worked was most remarkable,
for he did not, as might have been supposed, spin his
cables with his face to the leaf, but throwing himself on his
back, which was turned towards the leaf, he hung with his
whole weight by his first-made cables. This, by drawing
them into the form of a curve, shortened them, and consequently
pulled the edge of the leaf down towards the mid-rib.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
The weight of his body was not, however, the only
power which he employed; for, using the terminal pro-legs
as a point of support, he exerted the whole muscles of his
body to shorten his threads, and pull down the edge of the
leaf. When he had drawn the threads as tight as he could, he
held them till he spun fresh ones of sufficient strength to retain
the leaf in the bent position into which he had pulled it.
He then left the first series to hang loose while he shortened
the fresh-spun ones as before. This process was continued
till he had worked down about an inch and a half of the leaf,
as much as he deemed sufficient for his habitation. This
was the first part of the architecture.</p>

<p>By the time he had worked to the end of the fold, he had
brought the edge of the leaf to touch the mid-rib; but it was
only held in this position by a few of the last-spun threads,
for all the first-spun ones hung loose within. Apparently
aware of this, the insect protruded more than half of its body
through the small aperture left at the end, and spun several
bundles of threads on the outside precisely similar to those
ropes of a tent which extend beyond the canvas, and are pegged
into the ground. Unwilling to trust the exposure of his
whole body on the outside, lest he should be seized by the
first sand-wasp (<i>odynerus</i>) or sparrow which might descry
him, he now withdrew to complete the internal portion of
his dwelling, where the threads were hanging loose and disorderly.
For this purpose he turned his head about, and
proceeded precisely as he had done at the beginning of his
task, but taking care to spin his new threads so as to leave
the loose ones on the outside, and make his apartment smooth
and neat. When he again reached the opposite end, he
constructed there also a similar series of cables on the outside,
and then withdrew to give some final touches to the
interior.</p>

<p>It is said by Kirby and Spence,<a name="FNanchor_BJ" id="FNanchor_BJ"></a><a href="#Footnote_BJ" class="fnanchor">[BJ]</a> that when these leaf-rolling
insects find that the larger nervures of the leaves are
so strong as to prevent them from bending, they &ldquo;weaken it
by gnawing it here and there half through.&rdquo; We have never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
observed the circumstance, though we have witnessed the
process in some hundreds of instances; and we doubt the
statement, from the careful survey which the insect makes
of the capabilities of the leaf before the operation is begun.
If she found upon examination that a leaf would not bend,
she would reject it, as we have often seen happen, and pass to
another. (J. R.)</p>

<p class="tb_stars">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>A species of leaf-roller, of the most diminutive size,
merits particular mention, although it is not remarkable
in colour or figure. It is without hair, of a greenish-white,
and has all the vivacity of the other leaf-rollers. Sorrel is
the plant on which it feeds; and the manner in which it
rolls a portion of the leaf is very ingenious.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 231px;">
<img src="images/188.png" width="231" height="264" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Leaf-rolling Caterpillars of the Sorrel.</div>
</div>

<p>The structure which it contrives is a sort of conical
pyramid, composed of five or six folds lapped round each
other. From the position of this little cone the caterpillar
has other labours to perform, beside that of rolling the leaf.
It first cuts across the leaf, its teeth acting as a pair of
scissors; but it does not entirely detach this segment. It
rolls it up very gradually, by attaching threads of silk to
the plane surface of the leaf, as we have before seen; and
then, having cut in a different direction, sets the cone upright,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
by weaving other threads, attached to the centre of the roll
and the plane of the leaf, upon which it throws the weight
of its body. This, it will be readily seen, is a somewhat
complicated effort of mechanical skill. It has been minutely
described by M. Réaumur; but the preceding representation
will perhaps make the process clearer than a more detailed
account.</p>

<p>This caterpillar, like those of which we have already
spoken, devours all the interior of the roll. It weaves,
also, in the interior, a small and thin cocoon of white silk,
the tissue of which is made compact and close. It is then
transformed into a chrysalis.</p>

<img src="images/189.png" width="344" height="364" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Nests of the Hesperia malvæ, with Caterpillar, Chrysalis, and Butterflies.</div>
</div>

<p>The caterpillars of two of our largest and handsomest
butterflies, the painted lady (<i>Cynthia cardui</i>, <span class="smcap">Stephens</span>),
and the admiral, or <i>Alderman</i> of the London fly-fanciers
(<i>Vanessa atalanta</i>), are also leaf-rollers. The first selects
the leaves of the great spear-thistle, and sometimes those
of the stemless or star-thistle, which might be supposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
rather difficult to bend; but the caterpillar is four times as
large and strong as those which we have been hitherto describing.
In some seasons it is plentiful; in others it is
rarely to be met with: but the admiral is seldom scarce in
any part of the country; and by examining the leaves of
nettles which appear folded edge to edge, in July and
August, the caterpillar may be readily found.</p>

<p>Another butterfly (<i>Hesperia malvæ</i>) is met with on dry
banks where mallows grow, in May, or even earlier, and
also in August, but is not indigenous. The caterpillar,
which is grey, with a black head, and four sulphur-coloured
spots on the neck, folds around it the leaves of the mallow,
upon which it feeds. There is nothing, however, peculiarly
different in its proceedings from those above described;
but the care with which it selects and rolls up
one of the smaller leaves, when it is about to be transformed
into a chrysalis, is worthy of remark; it joins it, indeed, so
completely round and round, that it has somewhat the
resemblance of an egg. Within this green cell it lies secure,
till the time arrives when it is ready to burst its cerements,
and trust to the quickness of its wings for protection against
its enemies.</p>

<p>Among the nests of caterpillars which roll up parcels of
leaves, we know none so well contrived as those which are
found upon willows and a species of osier. The long and
narrow leaves of these plants are naturally adapted to be
adjusted parallel to each other; for this is the direction
which they have at the end of each stalk, when they are
not entirely developed. One kind of small smooth caterpillar
(<i>Tortrix chlorana</i>), with sixteen feet, the under part
of which is brown, and streaked with white, fastens these
leaves together, and makes them up into parcels. There is
nothing particularly striking in the mechanical manner in
which it constructs them. It does precisely what we should
do in a similar case: it winds a thread round those leaves
which must be kept together, from a little above their termination
to a very short distance from their extreme point;
and as it finds the leaves almost constantly lying near each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
other, it has little difficulty in bringing them together, as is
shown in the following cut, <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>The prettiest of these parcels are those which are made
upon a kind of osier, the borders of whose leaves sometimes
form columnar bundles before they become developed. A
section of these leaves has the appearance of filigree-work
(see <i>b</i>).</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 402px;">
<img src="images/191.png" width="402" height="467" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Nest of Willow-leaf Roller.</span>
</div>

<p>A caterpillar which feeds upon the willow, and whose
singular attitudes have obtained for it the trivial name of
<i>Ziczac</i>, also constructs for itself an arbour of the leaves,
by drawing them together in an ingenious manner. M.
Roesel<a name="FNanchor_BK" id="FNanchor_BK"></a><a href="#Footnote_BK" class="fnanchor">[BK]</a> has given a tolerable representation of this nest,
and of the caterpillar. The caterpillar is found in June;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
and the moth (<i>Notodonta ziczac</i>) from May to July in the
following year (see cut, <a href="#Page_151">p. 151</a>).</p>

<p>Beside those caterpillars which live solitary in the folds
of a leaf, there are others which associate, employing their
united powers to draw the leaves of the plants they feed
upon into a covering for their common protection. Among
these we may mention the caterpillar of a small butterfly,
the plantain or Glanville fritillary (<i>Melitea cinxia</i>), which is
very scarce in this country.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 397px;">
<img src="images/192.png" width="397" height="428" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Ziczac Caterpillar and Nest.</span>
</div>

<p>Although a colony of these caterpillars is not numerous,
seldom amounting to a hundred individuals, the place which
they have selected is not hard to discover. Their abode
may be seen in the meadow in form of a tuft of herbage
covered with a white web, which may readily be mistaken,
at first view, for that of a spider, but closer inspection soon
corrects this notion. It is, in fact, a sort of common tent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
in which the whole brood lives, eats, and undergoes the
usual transformations. The shape of this tent, for the most
part, approaches the pyramidal, though that depends much
upon the natural growth of the herbage which composes it.
The interior is divided into compartments formed by the
union of several small tents, as it were, to which others have
been from time to time added according to the necessities of
the community.</p>

<p>When they have devoured all the leaves, or at least those
which are most tender and succulent, they abandon their
first camp, and construct another contiguous to it under a
tuft of fresh leaves. Several of these encampments may
sometimes be seen within the distance of a foot or two, when
they can find plantain (<i>Plantago lanceolata</i>) fit for their
purpose; but though they prefer this plant, they content
themselves with grass if it is not to be procured.</p>

<p>When they are about to cast their skins, but particularly
when they perceive the approach of winter, they construct
a more durable apartment in the interior of their principal
tent. The ordinary web is thin and semi-transparent, permitting
the leaves to be seen through it; but their winter
canvas, if we may call it so, is thick, strong, and quite
opaque, forming a sort of circular hall without any partition,
where the whole community lie coiled up and huddled
together.</p>

<p>Early in spring they issue forth in search of fresh food,
and again construct tents to protect them from cold and
rain, and from the mid-day sun.</p>

<p>M. Réaumur found upon trial, that it was not only the
caterpillars hatched from the eggs of the same mother
which would unite in constructing the common tent; for
different broods, when put together, worked in the same
social and harmonious manner. We ourselves ascertained,
during the present summer (1829), that this principle of
sociality is not confined to the same species, nor even to
the same genus. The experiment which we tried was to
confine two broods of different species to the same branch,
by placing it in a glass of water to prevent their escape.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
The caterpillars which we experimented on were several
broods of the brown-tail moth (<i>Porthesia auriflua</i>) and the
lackey (<i>Clisiocampa neustria</i>). These we found to work
with as much industry and harmony in constructing the
common tent as if they had been at liberty on their native
trees; and when the lackeys encountered the brown-tails
they manifested no alarm nor uneasiness, but passed over
the backs of one another, as if they had made only a portion
of the branch. In none of their operations did they seem
to be subject to any discipline, each individual appearing to
work, in perfecting the structure, from individual instinct,
in the same manner as was remarked by M. Huber in the
case of the hive-bees. In making such experiments, it is
obvious that the species of caterpillars experimented with
must feed upon the same sort of plant.<a name="FNanchor_BL" id="FNanchor_BL"></a><a href="#Footnote_BL" class="fnanchor">[BL]</a> (J. R.)</p>

<p>The design of the caterpillars in rolling up the leaves
is not only to conceal themselves from birds and predatory
insects, but also to protect themselves from the cuckoo-flies,
which lie in wait in every quarter to deposit their eggs
in their bodies, that their progeny may devour them. Their
mode of concealment, however, though it appear to be
cunningly contrived and skilfully executed, is not always
successful, their enemies often discovering their hiding-place.
We happened to see a remarkable instance of this last
summer (1828), in the case of one of the lilac caterpillars
which had changed into a chrysalis within the closely-folded
leaf. A small ichneumon, aware it should seem of the very
spot where the chrysalis lay within this leaf, was seen boring
through it with her ovipositor, and introducing her eggs
through the punctures thus made into the body of the
dormant insect. We allowed her to lay all her eggs, about
six in number, and then put the leaf under an inverted glass.
In a few days the eggs of the cuckoo-fly were hatched, the
grubs devoured the lilac chrysalis, and finally changed into
pupæ in a case of yellow silk, and into perfect insects like
their parents. (J. R.)</p>

<p class="caption2">INSECTS FORMING HABITATIONS OF DETACHED LEAVES.</p>


<p>The habitations of the insects which we have just described
consist of growing leaves, bent, rolled, or pressed together,
and fixed in their positions by silken threads. But
there are other habitations of a similar kind, which are constructed
by cutting out and detaching a whole leaf, or a portion
of a leaf. We have already seen how dexterously the upholsterer-bees
cut out small parts of leaves and petals with their
mandibles, and fit them into their cells. Some of the caterpillars
do not exhibit quite so much neatness and elegance
as the leaf-cutting bees, though their structures answer all
the purposes intended; but there are others, as we shall
presently see, that far excel the bees, at least in the delicate
minutiæ of their workmanship. We shall first advert to
those structures which are the most simple.</p>

<p class="tb_stars">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Not far from Longchamps, in a road through the Bois
de Boulogne, is a large marsh, which M. Réaumur never
observed to be in a dry state even during summer. This
marsh is surrounded with very lofty oaks, and abounds with
pondweed, the water-plant named by botanists <i>potamogeton</i>.
The shining leaves of this plant, which are as large as those
of the laurel or orange-tree, but thicker and more fleshy,
are spread upon the surface of the water. Having pulled up
several of these about the middle of June, M. Réaumur
observed, beneath one of the first which he examined, an
elevation of an oval shape, which was formed out of a leaf of
the same plant. He carefully examined it, and discovered
that threads of silk were attached to this elevation. Breaking
the threads, he raised up one of the ends, and saw a cavity,
in which a caterpillar (<i>Hydrocampa potamogeta</i>) was lodged.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
An indefatigable observer, such as M. Réaumur, would
naturally follow up this discovery; and he has accordingly
given us a memoir of the pondweed tent-maker, distinguished
by his usual minute accuracy.</p>

<p>In order to make a new habitation, the caterpillar fastens
itself on the under side of a leaf of the <i>Potamogeton</i>. With
its mandibles it pierces some part of this leaf, and afterwards
gradually gnaws a curved line, marking the form of the piece
which it wishes to detach. When the caterpillar has cut off,
as from a piece of cloth, a patch of leaf of the size and
shape suited to its purpose, it is provided with half of the
materials requisite for making a tent. It takes hold of this
piece by its mandibles, and conveys it to the situation on
the under side of its own or another leaf, whichever is found
most appropriate. It is there disposed in such a manner
that the under part of the patch&mdash;the side which was the
under part of the entire leaf&mdash;is turned towards the under
part of the new leaf, so that the inner walls of the cell or
tent are always made by the under part of two portions of
leaf. The leaves of the potamogeton are a little concave on
the under side; and thus the caterpillar produces a hollow
cell, though the rims are united.</p>

<p>The caterpillar secures the leaf in its position by threads
of white silk. It then weaves in the cavity a cocoon, which
is somewhat thin, but of very close tissue. There it shuts
itself up, to appear again only in the form of the perfect
insect, and is soon transformed into a chrysalis. In this
cocoon of silk no point touches the water; whilst the tent
of leaves, lined with silk, has been constructed underneath
the water. This fact proves that the caterpillar has a particular
art by which it repels the water from between the leaves.</p>

<p>When the caterpillar, which has thus conveyed and
disposed a patch of leaf against another leaf, is not ready to
be transformed into a chrysalis, it applies itself to make a
tent or habitation which it may carry everywhere about with
it. It begins by slightly fixing the piece against the perfect
leaf, leaving intervals all round, between the piece and leaf,
at which it may project its head. The piece which it has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
fixed serves as a model for cutting out a similar piece in the
other leaf. The caterpillar puts them accurately together,
except at one end of the oval, where an opening is left for
the insect to project its head through. When the caterpillar
is inclined to change its situation, it draws itself forward by
means of its scaly limbs, riveted upon the leaf. The membraneous
limbs, which are riveted against the inner sides of
the tents, oblige it to follow the anterior part of the body,
as it advances. The caterpillar, also, puts its head out of the
tent every time it desires to eat.</p>

<p>There is found on the common chickweed (<i>Stellaria media</i>),
towards the end of July, a middle-sized smooth green caterpillar,
having three brown spots bordered with white on the
back, and six legs and ten pro-legs, whose architecture is
worthy of observation. When it is about to go into chrysalis,
towards the beginning of August, it gnaws off, one by one,
a number of the leaves and smaller twigs of the chickweed,
and adjusts them into an oval cocoon, somewhat rough and unfinished
externally, but smooth, uniform, and finely tapestried
with white silk within. Here it undergoes its transformation
securely, and, when the period of its pupa trance has
expired in the following July, it makes its exit in the form
of a yellowish moth, with several brown spots above, and a
brown band on each of its four wings below. It is also furnished
with a sort of tail.</p>

<p>On the cypress-spurge (<i>Euphorbia cyparissias</i>), a native
woodland plant, but not of very common occurrence, may
be found, towards the end of October, a caterpillar of a
middle size, sparely tufted with hair, and striped with black,
white, red, and brown. The leaves of the plant, which are in
the form of short narrow blades of grass, are made choice of
by the caterpillar to construct its cocoon, which it does with
great neatness and regularity, the end of each leaf, after it
has been detached from the plant, being fixed to the stem,
and the other leaves placed parallel, as they are successively
added. The other ends of all these are bent inwards, so as
to form a uniformly rounded oblong figure, somewhat larger
at one end than at the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>A caterpillar which builds a very similar cocoon to the
last-mentioned may be found upon a more common plant&mdash;the
yellow snap-dragon or toad-flax (<i>Antirrhinum linaria</i>)&mdash;which
is to be seen in almost every hedge. It is somewhat
shaped like a leech, is of a middle size, and the prevailing
colour pearl-grey, but striped with yellow and black. It
spins up about the beginning of September, forming the
outer coating of pieces of detached leaves of the plant, and
sometimes of whole leaves placed longitudinally, the whole
disposed with great symmetry and neatness. The moth
appears in the following June.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Cypress-Spurge Caterpillar&mdash;(<i>Acronycta Euphrasiæ</i>)&mdash;with a Cocoon, on a branch.</span>
</div>

<p>It is worthy of remark, as one of the most striking
instances of instinctive foresight, that the caterpillars which
build structures of this substantial description are destined
to lie much longer in their chrysalis trance than those which
spin merely a flimsy web of silk. For the most part, indeed,
the latter undergo their final transformation in a few weeks;
while the former continue entranced the larger portion of a
year, appearing in the perfect state the summer after their
architectural labours have been completed. (J. R.) This
is a remarkable example of the instinct which leads these
little creatures to act as if under the dictates of prudence,
and with a perfect knowledge of the time, be it long or
short, which will elapse before the last change of the pupa
takes place. That the caterpillar, while weaving its cocoon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and preparing to assume the pupa state, exercises any reflective
faculties, or is aware of what is about to occur relative
to its own self, we cannot admit. It enters upon a work of
which it has had no previous experience, and which is performed,
as far as contingencies allow, in the same manner
by every caterpillar of the same species. Its labours, its
mode of carrying them on, and the very time in which they
are to be commenced, are all pre-appointed; and an instinctive
impulse urges and guides; and with this instinct
its organic endowments are in precise harmony; nor does
instinct ever impel to labours for which an animal is not
provided. &ldquo;The same wisdom,&rdquo; says Bonnet, &ldquo;which has
constructed and arranged with so much art the various
organs of animals, and has made them concur towards one
determined end, has also provided that the different operations
which are the natural results of the economy of the
animal should concur towards the same end. The creature
is directed towards his object by an invisible hand; he executes
with precision, and by one effort, those works which
we so much admire; he appears to act as if he reasoned, to
return to his labour at the proper time, to change his scheme
in case of need. But in all this he only obeys the secret
influence which drives him on. He is but an instrument
which cannot judge of each action, but is wound up by that
adorable Intelligence, which has traced out for every insect
its proper labours, as he has traced the orbit of each planet.
When, therefore, I see an insect working at the construction
of a nest, or a cocoon, I am impressed with respect, because
it seems to me that I am at a spectacle where the Supreme
Artist is hid behind the curtain.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_BM" id="FNanchor_BM"></a><a href="#Footnote_BM" class="fnanchor">[BM]</a></p>

<p>There is a small sort of caterpillar which may be found
on old walls, feeding upon minute mosses and lichens, the
proceedings of which are well worthy of attention. They
are similar, in appearance and size, to the caterpillar of the
small cabbage-butterfly (<i>Pontia rapæ</i>), and are smooth and
bluish. The material which they use in building their
cocoons is composed of the leaves and branchlets of green
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
moss, which they cut into suitable pieces, detaching at the
same time along with them a portion of the earth in which
they grow. They arrange these upon the walls of their
building, with the moss on the outside, and the earth on the
inside, making a sort of vault of the tiny bits of green moss
turf, dug from the surface of the wall. So neatly, also, are
the several pieces joined, that the whole might well be supposed
to be a patch of moss which had grown in form of an
oval tuft, a little more elevated than the rest growing on the
wall. When these caterpillars are shut up in a box with
some moss, without earth, they construct with it cells in form
of a hollow ball, very prettily plaited and interwoven.</p>

<p>In May last (1829), we found on the walls of Greenwich
Park a great number of caterpillars, whose manners bore
some resemblance to those of the grub described by M.
Réaumur. (J. R.) They were of middle size, with a dull-orange
stripe along the back; the head and sides of the
body black, and the belly greenish. Their abodes were
constructed with ingenuity and care. A caterpillar of this
sort appears to choose either a part where the mortar contains
a cavity, or it digs one suited to its design. Over the
opening of the hollow in the mortar it builds an arched
wall, so as to form a chamber considerably larger than is
usual with other architect caterpillars. It selects grains of
mortar, brick, or lichen, fixing them, by means of silk, firmly
into the structure. As some of these vaulted walls were
from an inch to an inch and a half long, and about a third
of an inch wide and deep, it may be well imagined that it
would require no little industry and labour to complete the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
work; yet it does not demand more than a few hours for
the insect to raise it from the foundation. Like all other
insect architects, this caterpillar uses its own body for a
measuring-rule, and partly for a mould, or rather a block or
centre to shape the walls by, curving itself round and round
concentrically with the arch which it is building.</p>

<p>We afterwards found one of these caterpillars, which had
dug a cell in one of the softest of the bricks, covering itself
on the outside with an arched wall of brick-dust, cemented
with silk. As this brick was of a bright-red colour, we were
thereby able to ascertain that there was not a particle of
lichen employed in the structure.</p>

<p>The neatness mentioned by Réaumur, as remarkable in
his moss-building caterpillars, is equally observable in that
which we have just described; for, on looking at the surface
of the wall, it would be impossible for a person unacquainted
with those structures to detect where they were placed, as
they are usually, on the outside, level with the adjoining
brick-work; and it is only when they are opened by the
entomologist, that the little architect is perceived lying snug
in his chamber. If a portion of the wall be thus broken
down, the caterpillar immediately commences repairing the
breach, by piecing in bits of mortar and fragments of lichen,
till we can scarcely distinguish the new portion from the
old.</p>

</div>

<p>There is a very interesting class of grubs which live under
water, where they construct for themselves moveable
tents of various materials as their habits direct them, or as
the substances they require can be conveniently procured.
Among the materials used by these singular grubs, well-known
to fishermen by the name of <i>caddis-worms</i>, and to
naturalists as the <i>larvæ</i> of the four-winged flies in the order
<i>Trichoptera</i> of Kirby and Spence, we may mention sand,
stones, shells, wood, and leaves, which are skilfully joined
and strongly cemented. One of these grubs forms a pretty
case of leaves glued together longitudinally, but leaving an
aperture sufficiently large for the inhabitant to put out its
head and shoulders when it wishes to look about for food.
Another employs pieces of reed cut into convenient lengths,
or of grass, straw, wood, &amp;c., carefully joining and cementing
each piece to its fellow as the work proceeds; and he
frequently finishes the whole by adding a broad piece longer
than the rest to shade his door-way overhead, so that he
may not be seen from above. A more laborious structure is
reared by the grub of a beautiful caddis-fly (<i>Phryganea</i>),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
which weaves together a group of the leaves of aquatic
plants into a roundish ball, and in the interior of this forms
a cell for its abode. The fallowing figure from Roesel will
give a more precise notion of this structure than a lengthened
description.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 211px;">
<img src="images/203a.png" width="211" height="233" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Another of these aquatic architects makes choice of the
tiny shells of young fresh-water mussels and snails (<i>Planorbis</i>),
to form a moveable grotto; and as these little shells are for
the most part inhabited, he keeps the poor animals close
prisoners, and drags them without mercy along with him.
These grotto-building grubs are by no means uncommon in
ponds; and in chalk districts, such as the country about
Woolwich and Gravesend, they are very abundant.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 401px;">
<img src="images/203b.png" width="401" height="179" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Shell Nests of Caddis-Worms.</span>
</div>

<p>One of the most surprising instances of their skill occurs
in the structures of which small stones are the principal
material. The problem is to make a tube about the width
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
of the hollow of a wheat-straw or a crow-quill, and equally
smooth and uniform. Now the materials being small stones
full of angles and irregularities, the difficulty of performing
this problem will appear to be considerable, if not insurmountable:
yet the little architects, by patiently examining
their stones and turning them round on every side, never
fail to accomplish their plans. This, however, is only part
of the problem, which is complicated with another condition,
and which we have not found recorded by former observers,
namely, that the under-surface shall be flat and smooth,
without any projecting angles which might impede its progress
when dragged along the bottom of the rivulet where it
resides. The selection of the stones, indeed, may be accounted
for, from this species living in streams where, but
for the weight of its house, it would to a certainty be swept
away. For this purpose, it is probable that the grub makes
choice of larger stones than it might otherwise want; and
therefore also it is that we frequently find a case composed
of very small stones and sand, to which, when nearly
finished, a large stone is added by way of ballast. In other
instances, when the materials are found to possess too great
specific gravity, a bit of light wood, or a hollow straw, is
added to buoy up the case.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark, that the cement, used in all these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
cases, is superior to pozzolana<a name="FNanchor_BN" id="FNanchor_BN"></a><a href="#Footnote_BN" class="fnanchor">[BN]</a> in standing water, in which
it is indissoluble. The grubs themselves are also admirably
adapted for their mode of life, the portion of their bodies
which is always enclosed in the case being soft like a meal-worm,
or garden-caterpillar, while the head and shoulders,
which are for the most part projected beyond the door-way
in search of food, are firm, hard, and consequently less liable
to injury than the protected portion, should it chance to be
exposed.</p>

<p>We have repeatedly tried experiments with the inhabitants
of those aquatic tents, to ascertain their mode of
building. We have deprived them of their little houses,
and furnished them with materials for constructing new
ones, watching their proceedings from their laying the first
stone or shell of the structure. They work at the commencement
in a very clumsy manner, attaching a great number of
chips to whatever materials may be within their reach with
loose threads of silk, and many of these they never use at
all in their perfect building. They act, indeed, much like
an unskilful workman trying his hand before committing
himself upon an intended work of difficult execution.
Their main intention is, however, to have abundance of
materials within reach: for after their dwelling is fairly
begun, they shut themselves up in it, and do not again
protrude more than half of their body to procure materials;
and even when they have dragged a stone, a shell, or a chip
of reed within building reach, they have often to reject it as
unfit. (J. R.)</p>

<p>[We have here some examples of the latter kind of nest,
<i>i. e.</i>, those habitations which are made of stones and shells.
Beginning at the upper left-hand figure, we find one that is
made of moderately-sized stones cemented together in a way
that reminds the observer of the manner in which a builder
forms irregular stones into a wall. Next to it is another, in
which the stones are larger and narrower, and are arranged
much as some of the caddis-worms arrange pieces of stick and
straw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>In the second, and on the left-hand side, is a very long
and simple tube, made of a grass stem, and balanced by three
little sticks attached to its centre. The next figure represents
a number of sand-tubes attached to each other. These are
built up laboriously of single particles of sand, and are
remarkable for their peculiar horn-like shape, the tube
having the same regular curve as the horn of an ox or
antelope, and tapering gradually from the base to the top.
A somewhat similar tube, but of larger size, is shown in the
right-hand figure.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 434px;">
<img src="images/206.png" width="434" height="393" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Any one who wishes to see one of these creatures rebuild
its house can do so by carefully removing it from its tube,
and supplying it with fresh material. Very great care must
be taken in the removal, as the grub is easily damaged, and
it holds so tightly to the tube with a pair of pincers at
the end of its body, that it must rather be coaxed than
driven out.</p>

<p>If desirable, they can be made to build their new houses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
of most singular materials. A lady, Miss Smee, was very
successful in a series of experiments which she made with
these insects, forcing them to make tubes of different colours
and patterns, by supplying them with coloured sand, pieces
of stained glass of various hues, gold dust, and similar
materials. Although there was scarcely any material which
they would not use, they seemed to consider a certain
amount of angularity as essential, and rejected any object,
such as a bead, of which the surface was perfectly rounded,
while they would accept the same, if it were broken or
indented.</p>

<p>When the caddis-grub has ceased from feeding, and is
about to pass into the perfect stage, it spins over the mouth
of the tube a strong silken web. This web is made in quite
a pretty pattern, and being woven with rather wide meshes,
it allows the water to flow through the tube while it prevents
any aquatic foes from penetrating and destroying the
pupa.</p>

<p>The remaining figures of the illustration represent tubes,
around which are built a quantity of small shells. Generally,
stones are mixed with the shells; but in some cases, shells
seem to be almost the only material.]</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Carpenter-Caterpillars.</p>

<p>Insects, though sometimes actuated by an instinct apparently
blind, unintelligent, or unknown to themselves,
manifest in other instances a remarkable adaptation of
means to ends. We have it in our power to exemplify
this in a striking manner by the proceedings of the caterpillar
of a goat-moth (<i>Cossus ligniperda</i>) which we kept till
it underwent its final change.</p>

<p>This caterpillar, which abounds in Kent and many other
parts of the island, feeds on the wood of willows, oaks,
poplars, and other trees, in which it eats extensive galleries;
but it is not contented with the protection afforded by these
galleries during the colder months of winter, before the
arrival of which it scoops out a hollow in the tree, if it does
not find one ready prepared, sufficiently large to contain its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
body in a bent or somewhat coiled-up position. On sawing
off a portion of an old poplar in the winter of 1827, we
found such a cell with a caterpillar coiled up in it.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Winter Nest of the Goat-Caterpillar.</span>
</div>

<p>It had not, however, been contented with the bare walls
of the retreat which it had hewn out of the tree, for it had
lined it with a fabric as thick as coarse broadcloth, and
equally warm, composed of the raspings of the wood scooped
out of the cell, united with the strong silk which every
species of caterpillar can spin. In this snug retreat our
caterpillar, if it had not been disturbed, would have spent
the winter without eating; but upon being removed into a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
warm room and placed under a glass along with some
pieces of wood, which it might eat if so inclined, it was
roused for a time from its dormant state, and began to move
about. It was not long, however, in constructing a new
cell for itself, no less ingenious than the former. It either
could not gnaw into the fir plank, where it was now placed
with a glass above it, or it did not choose to do so; for it
left it untouched, and made it the basis of the edifice it
began to construct. It formed, in fact, a covering for itself
precisely like the one from which we had dislodged it,&mdash;composed
of raspings of wood detached for the purpose
from what had been given it as food, the largest piece of
which was employed as a substantial covering and protection
for the whole. It remained in this retreat, motionless,
and without food, till revived by the warmth of the ensuing
spring, when it gnawed its way out, and began to eat voraciously,
to make up for its long fast.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Nest of Goat-Moth.&mdash;Figured from specimen, and raised to show the Pupa.</span>
</div>

<p>These caterpillars are three years in arriving at their
final change into the winged state; but as the one just
mentioned was nearly full grown, it began, in the month
of May, to prepare a cell, in which it might undergo its
metamorphosis. Whether it had actually improved its
skill in architecture by its previous experience we will not
undertake to say, but its second cell was greatly superior
to the first. In the first there was only one large piece of
wood employed; in the second, two pieces were placed in
such a manner as to support each other, and beneath the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
angle thus formed an oblong structure was made, composed,
as before, of wood-raspings and silk, but much stronger in
texture than the winter cell. In a few weeks (four, if we
recollect aright) the moth came forth. (J. R.)</p>

<p>[I have now before me a series of three cocoons, made by
one caterpillar of the goat-moth, showing its increase in
size during the three years that it remained in the larval
state. They were found in an old willow tree, and occupied
different parts of the same burrow. The ravages which a
goat-moth caterpillar can make in a tree are almost incredible
to those who have not seen the long and tortuous burrows
which the insect will construct, burrows which at first are
small and insignificant, but which afterwards become large
enough to admit a man&rsquo;s finger.</p>

<p>Sometimes the tunnel runs just under the bark, and
sometimes it goes straight towards the centre of the tree;
and no small labour is required before it can be fully traced.
Still, the result is worth the labour, for it is most interesting
to trace the creature through its whole existence,
from the tiny hole which it made soon after its exit from
the egg, to the large aperture through which it emerged as
a moth. The whole of the tunnel is strongly imbued with
the peculiar and unpleasant odour which has given to the
goat-moth its popular name; and the scent is so persistent,
that it adheres to the fingers which have touched the
sides of the tunnel, and can scarcely be removed even by
repeated washings.</p>

<p>The moth itself is a well-known insect, though rarely
seen except by night. It is large, brown, round bodied;
the wings are covered with a soft and downy clothing, which
strongly reminds the observer of the plumage of an owl.]</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Larva of Ægeria.</span>
</div>

<p>A wood-boring caterpillar, of a species of moth much
rarer than the preceding (<i>Ægeria asiliformis</i>, <span class="smcap">Stephens</span>),
exhibits great ingenuity in constructing a cell for its metamorphosis.
We observed above a dozen of them during
this summer (1829) in the trunk of a poplar, one side of
which had been stripped of its bark. It was this portion
of the trunk which all the caterpillars selected for their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
final retreat, not one having been observed where the tree
was covered with bark. The ingenuity of the little architect
consisted in scooping its cell almost to the very surface of
the wood, leaving only an exterior covering of unbroken
wood, as thin as writing-paper. Previous, therefore, to the
chrysalis making its way through this feeble barrier, it
could not have been suspected that an insect was lodged
under the smooth wood. We observed more than one of
these in the act of breaking through this covering, within
which there is, besides, a round moveable lid of a sort of
brown wax. (J. R.)</p>

<p>Another architect caterpillar, frequently to be met with
in July on the leaves of the willow and the poplar, is, in
the fly-state, called the puss-moth (<i>Cerura vinula</i>). The
caterpillar is produced from brown-coloured shining eggs,
about the size of a pin&rsquo;s head, which are deposited&mdash;one,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
two, or more together&mdash;on the upper surface of a leaf. In
the course of six or eight weeks (during which time it
casts its skin thrice) it arrives at its full growth, when it
is about as thick, and nearly as long, as a man&rsquo;s thumb,
and begins to prepare a structure in which the pupa may
sleep securely during the winter. As we have, oftener than
once, seen this little architect at work, from the foundation
till the completion of its edifice, we are thereby enabled to
give the details of the process.</p>

<p>The puss, it may be remarked, does not depend for protection
on the hole of a tree, or the shelter of an overhanging
branch, but upon the solidity and strength of the fabric
which it rears. The material it commonly uses is the bark
of the tree upon which the cell is constructed; but when
this cannot be procured, it is contented to employ whatever
analogous materials may be within reach. One which we
had shut up in a box substituted the marble paper it was
lined with for bark, which it could not procure.<a name="FNanchor_BO" id="FNanchor_BO"></a><a href="#Footnote_BO" class="fnanchor">[BO]</a> With
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
silk it first wove a thin web round the edges of the place
which it marked out for its edifice, then it ran several
threads in a spare manner from side to side, and from end
to end, but very irregularly in point of arrangement; these
were intended for the skeleton or framework of the building.
When this outline was finished, the next step was to
strengthen each thread of silk by adding several (sometimes
six or eight) parallel ones, all of which were then glued
together into a single thread, by the insect running its
mandibles, charged with gluten, along the line. The
meshes, or spaces, which were thus widened by the compression
of the parallel threads, were immediately filled
up with fresh threads, till at length only very small spaces
were left. It was in this stage of the operation that the
paper came into requisition, small portions of it being
gnawed off the box and glued into the meshes. It was not,
however, into the meshes only that the bits of paper were
inserted; for the whole fabric was in the end thickly
studded over with them. In about half a day from the
first thread of the framework being spun the building was
completed. It was at first, however, rather soft, and
yielded to slight pressure with the finger; but as soon as
it became thoroughly dry, it was so hard that it could with
difficulty be penetrated with the point of a penknife.
(J. R.)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>
<p>[One puss-moth larva, which I reared, made its nest in a
rather curious manner. After it had ceased feeding it had
been placed on a marble mantelpiece under a glass tumbler,
as a temporary residence until a more appropriate dwelling
could be found for it. But its instincts urged it to make
its nest without delay, and it accordingly set to work, and
spun itself up in a cocoon composed entirely of its own
silk, neither the glass tumbler or the mantelpiece affording
it any material with which to harden the walls of its
dwelling.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 257px;">
<img src="images/214.png" width="257" height="128" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Cell built by the Larva of the Puss-Moth.</span>
</div>

<p>Consequently, the texture of the cocoon was of a rather
singular nature. The silken threads had been fused together
so as to form a translucent cocoon, looking as if it
had been made of gelatine, and being nearly equally transparent,
the chrysalis being plainly visible through its walls.
The cocoon was thin and elastic, as if it had been made of
very thin horn; and it was so tightly fixed to the mantelpiece
as well as to the tumbler, that it could not be removed
without damage. The moth suffered no injury from the
privation which the larva had to undergo.</p>

<p>The cocoons of the puss-moth are to be found upon the
trunks of trees, but they are so rough, and so greatly resembling
the bark, with which, indeed, their walls are
strengthened, that an inexperienced eye would fail to detect
them. Even when they have been pointed out to a novice in
practical entomology, he has failed to find them again whenever
his eye has been taken off their rugged outlines.]</p>

<p>A question will here suggest itself to the curious inquirer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
how the moth, which is not, like the caterpillar,
furnished with mandibles for gnawing, can find its way
through so hard a wall. To resolve this question, it is
asserted by recent naturalists (see Kirby and Spence, vol.
iii. p. 15) that the moth is furnished with a peculiar acid
for dissolving itself a passage. We have a specimen of the
case of a puss-moth, in which, notwithstanding its strength,
one of the ichneumons had contrived to deposit its eggs.
In the beginning of summer, when we expected the moth
to appear, and felt anxious to observe the recorded effects
of the acid, we were astonished to find a large orange
cuckoo-fly make its escape; while another, which attempted
to follow, stuck by the way and died. On detaching the
cell from the box, we found several others, which had not
been able to get out, and had died in their cocoons. (J. R.)</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Ichneumon (<i>Cphion luteum</i>), figured from the one mentioned.</span>
</div>

<p>Among the carpenter-grubs may be mentioned that of
the purple capricorn-beetle (<i>Callidium violaceum</i>), of which
the Rev. Mr. Kirby has given an interesting account in the
fifth volume of the &lsquo;Linnæan Transactions.&rsquo; This insect
feeds principally on fir timber which has been felled some
time without having had the bark stripped off; but it is
often found on other wood. Though occasionally taken in
this kingdom, it is supposed not to have been originally a
native. The circumstance of this destructive little animal
attacking only such timber as had not been stripped of its
bark ought to be attended to by all persons who have any
concern in this article; for the bark is a temptation not
only to this, but to various other insects; and much of the
injury done in timber might be prevented, if the trees were
all barked as soon as they were felled. The female is
furnished, at the posterior extremity of her body, with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
flat retractile tube, which she inserts between the bark
and the wood, to the depth of about a quarter of an inch,
and there deposits a single egg. By stripping off the bark,
it is easy to trace the whole progress of the grub, from the
spot where it is hatched, to that where it attains its full
size. It first proceeds in a serpentine direction, filling the
space which it leaves with its excrement, resembling sawdust,
and so stopping all ingress to enemies from without.
When it has arrived at its utmost dimensions, it does not
confine itself to one direction, but works in a kind of
labyrinth, eating backwards and forwards, which gives the
wood under the bark a very irregular surface: by this
means its paths are rendered of considerable width. The
bed of its paths exhibits, when closely examined, a curious
appearance, occasioned by the gnawings of its jaws, which
excavate an infinity of little ramified canals. When the
insect is about to assume its chrysalis state, it bores down
obliquely into the solid wood, to the depth sometimes of
three inches, and seldom if ever less than two, forming
holes nearly semi-cylindrical, and of exactly the form of
the grub which inhabits them. At first sight one would
wonder how so small and seemingly so weak an animal
could have strength to excavate so deep a mine; but when
we examine its jaws, our wonder ceases. These are large,
thick, and solid sections of a cone divided longitudinally,
which, in the act of chewing, apply to each other the
whole of their interior plane surface, so that they grind
the insect&rsquo;s food like a pair of millstones. Some of the
grubs are hatched in October; and it is supposed that
about the beginning of March they assume their chrysalis
state. At the place in the bark opposite to the hole from
whence they descended into the wood, the perfect insects
gnaw their way out, which generally takes place betwixt
the middle of May and the middle of June. These insects
are supposed only to fly in the night, but during the day
they may generally be found resting on the wood from
which they were disclosed. The grubs are destitute of
feet, pale, folded, somewhat hairy, convex above, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
divided into thirteen segments. Their head is large and
convex.<a name="FNanchor_BP" id="FNanchor_BP"></a><a href="#Footnote_BP" class="fnanchor">[BP]</a></p>

<p>It would not be easy to find a more striking example of
ingenuity than occurs in a small caterpillar which may
be found in May, on the oak, and is supposed by Kirby
and Spence to be that of the <i>Pyralis strigulalis</i>. It is of
a whitish-yellow colour, tinged with a shade of carnation,
and studded with tufts of red hairs on each segment, and
two brown spots behind the head. It has fourteen feet,
and the upper part of its body is much flatter than is
common in caterpillars. When this ingenious little insect
begins to form its cell, it selects a smooth young branch
of the oak, near an offgoing of the branchlets whose angle
may afford it some protection. It then measures out, with
its body for a rule, the space destined for its structure, the
basement of which is of a triangular form, with the apex
at the lower end. The building itself is composed of
small, rectangular, strap-shaped pieces of the outer bark of
the branch cut out from the immediate vicinity; the insect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
indeed never travels further for materials than the length
of its own body. Upon the two longest sides of the triangular
base it builds uniform walls, also of a triangular
shape, and both gradually diverging from each other as
they increase in height. These are formed with so much
mathematical precision, that they fit exactly when they
are afterwards brought into contact. As soon as the little
architect has completed these walls, which resemble very
much the feathers of an arrow, it proceeds to draw them
together in a manner similar to that which the leaf-rolling
caterpillars employ in constructing their abodes, by pulling
them with silken cords till they bend and converge. Even
when the two longest sides are thus joined, there is an
opening left at the upper end, which is united in a similar
manner. When the whole is finished, it requires close
inspection to distinguish it from the branch, being formed
of the same materials, and having consequently the same
colour and gloss. Concealment, indeed, may be supposed,
with some justice, to be the final object of the insect in
producing this appearance, the same principle being extensively
exemplified in numerous other instances.</p>

<p class="caption2">EARTH-MASON CATERPILLARS.</p>


<p>Many species of caterpillars are not only skilful in concealing
themselves in their cocoons, but also in the
concealment of the cocoon itself; so that even when that is
large, as in the instance of the death&rsquo;s-head hawk-moth
(<i>Acherontia atropos</i>), it is almost impossible to find it. We
allude to the numerous class of caterpillars which, previous
to their changing into the pupa state, bury themselves in
the earth. This circumstance would not be surprising, were
it confined to those which are but too well known in gardens,
from their feeding upon and destroying the roots of lettuce,
chicory, and other plants, as they pass a considerable portion
of their lives under ground; nor is it surprising that
those which retire under ground during the day, and come
abroad to feed in the night, should form their cocoons
where they have been in the habit of concealing themselves.
But it is very singular and unexpected, that caterpillars
which pass the whole of their life on plants and even on
trees, should afterwards bury themselves in the earth.
Yet, the fact is, that perhaps a greater number make their
cocoons under than above ground, particularly those which
are not clothed with hair.</p>

<p>Some of those caterpillars which go into the ground
previous to their change make no cocoon at all, but are
contented with a rude masonry of earth as a nest for their
pupæ: into the details of their operations it will not be so
necessary for us to go, as into those which exhibit more
ingenuity and care. When one of the latter is dug up it
has the appearance of nothing more than a small clod of
earth, of a roundish or oblong shape, but, generally, by no
means uniform. The interior, however, when it is laid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
open, always exhibits a cavity, smooth, polished, and regular,
in which the cocoon or the chrysalis lies secure (Fig. <span class="smcap">B</span>,
<a href="#Page_221">p. 221</a>). The polish of the interior is precisely such as
might be given to soft earth by moistening and kneading it
with great care. But beside this, it is usually lined with a
tapestry of silk, more or less thick, though this cannot
always be discovered without the aid of a magnifying glass.
This species of caterpillars, as soon as they have completed
their growth, go into the earth, scoop out, as the cossus does
in wood, a hollow cell of an oblong form, and line it with
pellets of earth, from the size of a grain of sand to that of a
pea&mdash;united, by silk or gluten, into a fabric more or less
compact, according to the species, but all of them fitted for
protecting the inhabitant, during its winter sleep, against
cold and moisture.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 452px;">
<img src="images/220.png" width="452" height="135" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Outside view of Nests of Earth-mason Caterpillars.</span>
</div>

<p>One of the examples of this occurs in the ghost-moth
(<i>Hepialus humuli</i>), which, before it retires into the earth,
feeds upon the roots of the hop or the burdock. Like
other insects which construct cells under ground, it lines
the cemented earthen walls of its cell with a smooth
tapestry of silk, as closely woven as the web of the house-spider.</p>

<p>Inaccurate observers have inferred that these earthen
structures were formed by a very rude and unskilful process&mdash;the
caterpillar, according to them, doing nothing more
than roll itself round, while the mould adhered to the gluey
perspiration with which they describe its body to be covered.
This is a process as far from the truth as Aristotle&rsquo;s account
of the spider spinning its web from wool taken from its
body. Did the caterpillar do nothing more than roll itself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
in the earth, the cavity would be a long tube fitted exactly
to its body (Fig. c): it is essentially different.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 368px;">
<img src="images/221.png" width="368" height="400" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Nests, &amp;c., of an Earth-mason Caterpillar.</span>
</div>

<p>It does not indeed require very minute observation to
perceive that every grain of earth in the structure is united
to the contiguous grains by threads of silk; and that consequently,
instead of the whole having been done at once, it
must have required very considerable time and labour.
This construction is rendered more obvious by throwing one
of these earthen cases into water, which dissolves the earth,
but does not act on the silk which binds it together. To
understand how this is performed, it may not be uninteresting
to follow the little mason from the beginning of his
task.</p>

<p>When one of those burrowing caterpillars has done feeding,
it enters the earth to the depth of several inches, till
it finds mould fit for its purpose. Having nowhere to throw
the earth which it may dig out, the only means in its power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of forming a cavity is to press it with its body; and, by
turning round and round for this purpose, an oblong hollow
is soon made. But were it left in this state, as Réaumur
well remarks, though the vault might endure the requisite
time by the viscosity of the earth alone, were no change to
take place in its humidity, yet, as a great number are
wanted to hold out for six, eight, and ten months, they
require to be substantially built; a mere lining of silk,
therefore, would not be sufficient, and it becomes necessary
to have the walls bound with silk to some thickness.</p>

<p>When a caterpillar cannot find earth sufficiently moist to
bear kneading into the requisite consistence, it has the
means of moistening it with a fluid which it ejects for the
purpose; and as soon as it has thus prepared a small pellet
of earth, it fits it into the wall of the vault, and secures it
with silk. As the little mason, however, always works on
the <i>inside</i> of the building, it does not, at first view, appear
in what manner it can procure materials for making one or
two additional walls on the inside of the one first built. As
the process takes place under ground, it is not easy to
discover the particulars, for the caterpillars will not work in
glazed boxes. The difficulty was completely overcome by
M. Réaumur, in the instance of the caterpillar of the water-betony
moth (<i>Cucullia scrophulariæ</i>, <span class="smcap">Schrank</span>), which he
permitted to construct the greater part of its underground
building, and then dug it up and broke a portion off from
the end, leaving about a third part of the whole to be rebuilt.
Those who are unacquainted with the instinct of
insects might have supposed that, being disturbed by the
demolition of its walls, it would have left off work; but the
stimulus of providing for the great change is so powerful,
that scarcely any disturbance will interrupt a caterpillar in
this species of labour.</p>

</div>

<p>The little builder accordingly was not long in recommencing
its task for the purpose of repairing the disorder,
which it accomplished in about four hours. At first it protruded
its body almost entirely beyond the breach which had
been made, to reconnoitre the exterior for building materials.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Earth was put within its reach, of the same kind as it had
previously used, and it was not long in selecting a grain
adapted to its purpose, which it fitted into the wall and
secured with silk. It first enlarged the outside of the wall
by the larger and coarser grains, and then selected finer for
the interior. But before it closed the aperture, it collected
a quantity of earth on the inside, wove a pretty thick net-work
tapestry of silk over the part which remained open,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
and into the meshes of this, by pushing and pressing, it
thrust grains of earth, securing them with silk till the whole
was rendered opaque; and the further operations of the
insect could no longer be watched, except that it was
observed to keep in motion, finishing, no doubt, the silken
tapestry of the interior of its little chamber. When it was
completed, M. Réaumur ascertained that the portion of the
structure which had been built under his eye was equally
thick and compact with the other, which had been done
under ground.</p>

<p>The grubs of several of the numerous species of may-fly
(<i>Ephemera</i>) excavate burrows for themselves in soft earth, on
the banks of rivers and canals, under the level of the
water, an operation well described by Scopoli, Swammerdam,
and Réaumur. The excavations are always proportioned
to the size of the inhabitant; and consequently, when it is
young and small, the hole is proportionally small, though,
with respect to extent, it is always at least double the
length of its body. The hole, being under the level of the
river, is always filled with water, so that the grub swims
in its native element, and while it is secure from being
preyed upon by fishes, it has its own food within easy reach.
It feeds, in fact, if we may judge from its <i>egesta</i>, upon the
slime or moistened clay with which its hole is lined.</p>

<p>In the bank of the stream at Lee, in Kent, we had occasion
to take up an old willow stump, which, previous to its being
driven into the bank, had been perforated in numerous
places by the caterpillar of the goat-moth (<i>Cossus ligniperda</i>).
From having been driven amongst the moist clay, these
perforations became filled with it, and the grubs of the
ephemeræ found them very suitable for their habitation: for
the wood supplied a more secure protection than if their
galleries had been excavated in the clay. In these holes of
the wood we found several empty, and some in which were
full-grown grubs. (J. R.)</p>

<p>The architecture of the grub of a pretty genus of beetles,
known to entomologists by the name of <i>Cincindela</i>, is peculiarly
interesting. It was first made known by the eminent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
French naturalists, Geoffroy, Desmarest, and Latreille. This
grub, which may be met with during spring, and also in
summer and autumn, in sandy places, is long, cylindric,
soft whitish, and furnished with six scaly brown feet. The
head is of a square form, with six or eight eyes, and very
large in proportion to the body. They have strong jaws,
and on the eighth joint of the body there are two fleshy
tubercles, thickly clothed with reddish hairs, and armed
with a recurved horny spine, the whole giving to the grub
the form of the letter Z.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Nests of Ephemeræ in holes of Cossus.</span>
</div>

<p>With their jaws and feet they dig into the earth to the
depth of eighteen inches, forming a cylindrical cavity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
greater diameter than their body, and furnished with a
perpendicular entrance. In constructing this, the grub
first clears away the particles of earth and sand by placing
them on its broad trapezoidal head, and carrying the load
in this manner beyond the area of the excavation. When
it gets deeper down, it climbs gradually up to the surface
with similar loads by means of the tubercles on its back,
above described. This process is a work of considerable
time and difficulty, and in carrying its loads the insect has
often to rest by the way to recover strength for a renewed
exertion. Not unfrequently, it finds the soil so ill adapted
to its operations, that it abandons the task altogether, and
begins anew in another situation. When it has succeeded in
forming a complete den, it fixes itself at the entrance by the
hooks of its tubercles, which are admirably adapted for the
purpose, forming a fulcrum or support, while the broad plate
on the top of the head exactly fits the aperture of the
excavation, and is on a level with the soil. In this position
the grub remains immovable, with jaws expanded, and ready
to seize and devour every insect which may wander within
its reach, particularly the smaller beetles; and its voracity
is so great, that it does not spare even its own species. It
precipitates its prey into the excavation, and in case of
danger it retires to the bottom of its den, a circumstance
which renders it not a little difficult to discover the grub.
The method adopted by the French naturalists was to
introduce a straw or pliant twig into the hole, while they
dug away, by degrees and with great care, the earth around
it, and usually found the grub at the bottom of the cell,
resting in a zig-zag position like one of the caterpillars of
the geometric moths.</p>

<p>When it is about to undergo its transformation into a
pupa, it carefully closes the mouth of the den, and retires to
the bottom in security.</p>

<p>It does not appear that the grub of the genus <i>Cincindela</i>
uses the excavation just described for the purpose of a trap
or pitfall, any further than that it can more effectually secure
its prey by tumbling them down into it; but there are other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
species of grubs which construct pitfalls for the express
purpose of traps. Among these is the larva of a fly (<i>Rhagio
vermileo</i>), not unlike the common flesh maggot. The den
which it constructs is in the form of a funnel, the sides of
which are composed of sand or loose earth. It forms this
pitfall of considerable depth, by throwing out the earth
obliquely on all sides; and when its trap is finished, it
stretches itself along the bottom, remaining stiff and motionless,
like a piece of wood. The last segment of the body is
bent at an angle with the rest, so as to form a strong
point of support in the struggles which it must often have to
encounter with vigorous prey. The instant that an insect
tumbles into the pitfall, the grub pounces upon it, writhes
itself round it like a serpent, transfixes it with its jaws, and
sucks its juices at its ease. Should the prey by any chance
escape, the grub hurls up jets of sand and earth, with
astonishing rapidity and force, and not unfrequently succeeds
in again precipitating it to the bottom of its trap.</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">The Ant-Lion.</p>

<p>The observations of the continental naturalists have made
known to us a pitfall constructed by an insect, the details of
whose operations are exceedingly curious; we refer to the
grub of the ant-lion (<i>Myrmeleon formicarius</i>), which, though
marked by Dr. Turton and Mr. Stewart as British, has not
(at least of late years) been found in this country. As it is
not, however, uncommon in France and Switzerland, it is probable
it may yet be discovered in some spot hitherto unexplored,
and if so, it will well reward the search of the curious.</p>

<p>The ant-lion grub being of a grey colour, and having its
body composed of rings, is not unlike a wood-louse (<i>Oniscus</i>),
though it is larger, more triangular, has only six legs, and
most formidable jaws, in form of a reaping-hook, or a pair of
calliper compasses. These jaws, however, are not for masticating,
but are perforated and tubular, for the purpose of
sucking the juices of ants, upon which it feeds. Vallisnieri
was therefore mistaken, as Réaumur well remarks, when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
supposed that he had discovered its mouth. Its habits require
that it should walk backwards, and this is the only
species of locomotion which it can perform. Even this sort
of motion it executes very slowly; and were it not for the
ingenuity of its stratagems, it would fare but sparingly,
since its chief food consists of ants, whose activity and swiftness
of foot would otherwise render it impossible for it to
make a single capture. Nature, however, in this, as in
nearly every other case, has given a compensating power to
the individual animal, to balance its privations. The ant-lion
is slow, but it is extremely sagacious; it cannot follow
its prey, but it can entrap it.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 404px;">
<img src="images/228.png" width="404" height="353" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Grub of the Ant-Lion, magnified, with one perfect Trap, and another begun.</span>
</div>

<p>The snare which the grub of the ant-lion employs consists
of a funnel-shaped excavation formed in loose sand, at the
bottom of which it lies in wait for the ants that chance to
stumble over the margin, and cannot, from the looseness of
the walls, gain a sufficient footing to effect their escape.</p>

<p>By shutting up one of these grubs in a box with loose
sand, it has been repeatedly observed constructing its trap
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of various dimensions, from one to nearly three inches in
diameter, according to circumstances.</p>

<p>In the &lsquo;Magazine of Natural History,&rsquo; 1838, p. 601, Mr.
Westwood gives a very interesting account of the mode in
which the ant-lion proceeds in the excavation of its pitfall, as
witnessed by himself in specimens procured in the Parc de
Belle Vue, near Paris, where, at the foot of a very high
sand-bank, these pits were numerous, and of various sizes,
but none exceeded an inch and a half or two inches in
diameter, and two-thirds of an inch deep. "The ant-lions
were of various sizes, corresponding to the size of their
retreats. I brought many of them to Paris, placing several
together in a box filled with sand. They, however, destroyed
one another whilst shut up in these boxes; and I only
succeeded in bringing three of them alive to England, one
of which almost immediately afterwards (on the 23rd of July)
enclosed itself in a globular cocoon of fine sand. The other
two afforded me many opportunities of observing their proceedings.
They were unable to walk forwards,&mdash;an anomalous
circumstance, and not often met with in animals
furnished with well-developed legs. It is generally backwards,
working in a spiral direction, that the creature moves,
pushing itself backwards and downwards at the same time,
the head being carried horizontally, and the back much
arched, so that the extremity of the body is forced into the
sand. In this manner it proceeds backwards (to use an
Hibernianism), forming little mole-hills in the sand. But it
does not appear to me that this retrograde motion has anything
to do with the actual formation of the cell, since, as
soon as it has fixed upon a spot for its retreat, it commences
throwing up the sand with the back of its head, jerking the
sand either behind its back or on one or the other side. It
shuts its long jaws, forming them into a kind of shovel, the
sharp edges of which it thrusts laterally into the sand on
each side of its head, and thereby contrives to lodge a
quantity of the sand upon the head as well as the jaws. The
motion is in fact something like that of the head of a goat,
especially when butting sideways in play. In this manner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
it contrives to throw away the sand, and by degrees to make
a hole entirely with its head, the fore legs not affording the
slightest assistance in the operation. During this performance
the head only is exposed, the insect having previously
pushed itself beneath the surface of the sand; but when it
has made the hole sufficiently deep, it withdraws the head
also, leaving only the jaws exposed, which are spread open in
a line, and laid on the sand so as to be scarcely visible. If
alarmed, the insect immediately takes a step backwards,
withdrawing the jaws; but when an insect falls into the
hole, the jaws are instinctively and instantaneously closed,
and the insect seized by the leg, wing, or body, just as it may
chance to fall within the reach of the ant-lion&rsquo;s jaws. If,
however, the insect be not seized, but attempts to escape, no
matter in what direction, the ant-lion immediately begins
twisting its head about, and shovelling up the sand with the
greatest agility, jerking it about on each side and backwards,
but never forwards, as misrepresented in some figures, until
the hole is made so much deeper, and such a disturbance
caused in the sides of the hole, that the insect is almost sure
to be brought down to the bottom, when it is seized by the
ant-lion, which immediately endeavours to draw it beneath
the sand; and if it be very boisterous, the ant-lion beats it
about, holding it firmly by the jaws until it is too weak for
further resistance. Hence, as the head of the ant-lion is
immersed in the sand, it is evident that the accounts given in
popular works of the instinct by which it throws the sand in
the direction of the escaping prey are not quite correct. The
act of throwing up the sand, when an insect has fallen into
the pit and attempts to escape, has evidently for its chief
object that of making the pit deeper and more conical, and
therefore more difficult of ascent."</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 401px;">
<img src="images/231.png" width="401" height="168" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Ant-Lion&rsquo;s Pitfalls, in an experimenting-box.</span>
</div>

<p>It is by the action of the hinder pair of its legs that the
ant-lion drags itself backwards, the other four pair being
extended trailing after it, and leaving an impression on the
surface of the fine sand over which it has passed; and when
burrowing its way beneath the surface of the sand, it
proceeds by short steps backwards. A portion of sand at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
each step is thrown on the head, owing to the hump-like
form of the back: this is immediately jerked away, the body
at the same time advancing another step in its backward and
spiral motion. Where it rests, a little hillock of sand is
raised by the body of the ant-lion underneath; while its
jaws emerge and spread flat on the surface. It now probably
commences its pitfall, the mode of excavating which we have
given in detail. From the spiral course described by the
ant-lion in its backward progress appears to have arisen the
idea of its tracing out a circle as the outline of its pitfall&mdash;as
would an architect or engineer; but whence sprang the
often-repeated statement, that the ant-lion loads its head
with sand by means of one of its legs, that nearest the
centre of the circle, we cannot conjecture. Nor do we know
how, as it works entirely buried with the exception of the
head, the ant-lion can act when it meets with a stone or other
obstacle, as M. Bonnet states he has repeatedly witnessed.
He observes that if the stone be small, it can manage to jerk
it out in the same manner as the sand; but when it is two
or three times larger and heavier than its own body, it must
have recourse to other means of removal. The larger stones
it usually leaves till the last; and when it has removed all
the sand which it intends, it then proceeds to try what it can
do with the less manageable obstacles. For this purpose it
crawls backwards to the place where a stone may be, and
thrusting its tail under it, is at great pains to get it properly
balanced on its back, by an alternate motion of the rings
composing its body. When it has succeeded in adjusting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the stone, it crawls up the side of the pit with great care,
and deposits its burthen on the outside of the circle. Should
the stone happen to be round, the balance can be kept only
with the greatest difficulty, as it has to travel with its load
upon a slope of loose sand, which is ready to give way at
every step; and often when the insect has carried it to the
very brink, it rolls off its back and tumbles down to the
bottom of the pit. This accident, so far from discouraging
the ant-lion, only stimulates it to more persevering efforts.
Bonnet observed it renew these attempts to dislodge a stone
five or six times. It is only when it finds it utterly impossible
to succeed, that it abandons the design and commences
another pit in a fresh situation. When it succeeds
in getting a stone beyond the line of its circle, it is not contented
with letting it rest there; but, to prevent it from again
rolling in, it goes on to push it to a considerable distance.
We maybe pardoned for pausing before we give full credence
to these details.</p>

<p>The ant-lion feeds only on the blood or juice of insects;
and as soon as it has extracted these, it tosses the dry carcase
out of its den.</p>

<p>When it is about to change into a pupa, it proceeds in
nearly the same manner as the caterpillar of the water-betony
moth (<i>Cucullia scrophulariæ</i>). It first builds a case of sand,
the particles of which are secured by threads of silk, and
then tapestries the whole with a silken web. Within this it
undergoes its transformation into a pupa, and in due time it
emerges in form of a four-winged fly, closely resembling the
dragon-flies (<i>Libellulæ</i>), vulgarly and erroneously called
<i>horse-stingers</i>.</p>

<p>The instance of the ant-lion naturally leads us to consider
the design of the Author of Nature in so nicely adjusting, in
all animals, the means of destruction and of escape. As the
larger quadrupeds of prey are provided with a most ingenious
machinery for preying on the weaker, so are those furnished
with the most admirable powers of evading their destroyers.</p>

<p>In the economy of insects, we constantly observe that the
means of defence, not only of the individual creatures, but of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
their larvæ and pupæ, against the attacks of other insects,
and of birds, is proportioned, in the ingenuity of their
arrangements, to the weakness of the insect employing them.
Those species which multiply the quickest have the greatest
number of enemies. Bradley, an English naturalist, has
calculated that two sparrows carry, in the course of a week,
above three thousand caterpillars to the young in their nests.
But though this is, probably, much beyond the truth, it is
certain that there is a great and constant destruction of
individuals going forward; and yet the species is never
destroyed. In this way a balance is kept up, by which one
portion of animated nature cannot usurp the means of life
and enjoyment which the world offers to another portion. In
all matters relating to reproduction, Nature is prodigal in
her arrangements. Insects have more stages to pass through
before they attain their perfect growth than other creatures.
The continuation of the species is, therefore, in many cases,
provided for by a much larger number of eggs being deposited
than ever become fertile. How many larvæ are produced,
in comparison with the number which pass into the pupa
state; and how many pupæ perish before they become perfect
insects! Every garden is covered with caterpillars; and
yet how few moths and butterflies, comparatively, are seen,
even in the most sunny season? Insects which lay few eggs
are, commonly, most remarkable in their contrivances for
their preservation. The dangers to which insect life is
exposed are manifold; and therefore are the contrivances
for its preservation of the most perfect kind, and invariably
adapted to the peculiar habits of each tribe. The same
wisdom determines the food of every species of insect; and
thus some are found to delight in the rose-tree, and some in
the oak. Had it been otherwise, the balance of vegetable
life would not have been preserved. It is for this reason
that the contrivances which an insect employs for obtaining
its food are curious, in proportion to the natural difficulties
of its structure. The ant-lion is carnivorous, but he has not
the quickness of the spider, nor can he spread a net over a
large surface, and issue from his citadel to seize a victim
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
which he has caught in his out-works. He is therefore
taught to dig a trap, where he sits like the unwieldy giants
of fable, waiting for some feeble one to cross his path. How
laborious and patient are his operations&mdash;how uncertain the
chances of success! Yet he never shrinks from them,
because his instinct tells him that by these contrivances
alone can he preserve his own existence, and continue that of
his species.</p>

<p class="caption2">CLOTHES-MOTH AND OTHER TENT-MAKING CATERPILLARS.&mdash;LEAF
AND BARK MINERS.</p>


<p>There are at least five different species of moths similar
in manners and economy, the caterpillars of which feed
upon animal substances, such as furs, woollen cloths, silk,
leather, and, what to the naturalist is no less vexing, upon
the specimens of insects and other animals preserved in his
cabinet. The moths in question are of the family named
<i>Tinea</i> by entomologists, such as the tapestry-moth (<i>Tinea
tapetzella</i>), the fur-moth (<i>Tinea pellionella</i>), the wool-moth
(<i>Tinea vestianella</i>), the cabinet-moth (<i>Tinea destructor</i>,
<span class="smcap">Stephens</span>), &amp;c.</p>

<p>The moths themselves are, in the winged state, small and
well fitted for making their way through the most minute
hole or chink, so that it is scarcely possible to exclude them
by the closeness of a wardrobe or a cabinet.<a name="FNanchor_BQ" id="FNanchor_BQ"></a><a href="#Footnote_BQ" class="fnanchor">[BQ]</a> If they
cannot effect an entrance when a drawer is out, or a door
open, they will contrive to glide through the key-hole; and
if they once get in, it is no easy matter to dislodge or
destroy them, for they are exceedingly agile, and escape out
of sight in a moment. Moufet is of opinion that the ancients
possessed an effectual method of preserving stuffs from the
moth, because the robes of Servius Tullius were preserved
up to the death of Sejanus, a period of more than five
hundred years. On turning to Pliny to learn this secret, we
find him relating that stuff laid upon a coffin will be ever
after safe from moths; in the same way as a person once
stung by a scorpion will never afterwards be stung by a bee,
or a wasp, or a hornet! Rhasis, again, says that cantharides
suspended in a house drive away moths; and he adds that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
they will not touch anything wrapped in a lion&rsquo;s skin!&mdash;the
poor little insects, says Réaumur, sarcastically, being probably
in bodily fear of so terrible an animal.<a name="FNanchor_BR" id="FNanchor_BR"></a><a href="#Footnote_BR" class="fnanchor">[BR]</a> Such are the stories
which fill the imagination even of philosophers, till real
science entirely expels them.</p>

<p>The effluvium of camphor or turpentine, or fumigation by
sulphur or chlorine, may sometimes kill them, when in the
winged state, but this will have no effect upon their eggs,
and seldom upon the caterpillars; for they wrap themselves
up too closely to be easily reached by any agent except heat.
This, when it can be conveniently applied, will be certain
either to dislodge or to kill them. When the effluvium of
turpentine, however, reaches the caterpillar, Bonnet says it
falls into convulsions, becomes covered with livid blotches,
and dies.<a name="FNanchor_BS" id="FNanchor_BS"></a><a href="#Footnote_BS" class="fnanchor">[BS]</a></p>

<p>The mother insect takes care to deposit her eggs on or
near such substances as she instinctively foreknows will be
best adapted for the food of the young, taking care to distribute
them so that there may be a plentiful supply and
enough of room for each. We have found, for example,
some of those caterpillars feeding upon the shreds of cloth
used in training wall-fruit trees; but we never saw more
than two caterpillars on one shred. This scattering of the
eggs in many places renders the effects of the caterpillars
more injurious, from their attacking many parts of a garment
or a piece of stuff at the same time. (J. R.)</p>

<p>When one of the caterpillars of this family issues from the
egg, its first care is to provide itself with a domicile, which
indeed seems no less indispensable to it than food; for, like
all caterpillars that feed under cover, it will not eat while it
remains unprotected. Its mode of building is very similar
to that which is employed by other caterpillars that make use
of extraneous materials. The foundation or framework is
made of silk secreted by itself, and into this it interweaves
portions of the material upon which it feeds. It is said by
Bingley, that "after having spun a fine coating of silk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
<i>immediately around its body</i>, it cuts the filaments of the wool
or fur close by the thread of the cloth, or by the skin, with
its teeth, which act in the manner of scissors, into convenient
lengths, and applies the bits, one by one, with great dexterity,
to the <i>outside</i> of its silken case."<a name="FNanchor_BT" id="FNanchor_BT"></a><a href="#Footnote_BT" class="fnanchor">[BT]</a> This statement, however,
is erroneous, and inconsistent with the proceedings not only
of the clothes-moth, but of every caterpillar that constructs a
covering. None of these build from within outwards, but
uniformly commence with the exterior wall, and finish by
lining the interior with the finest materials. Réaumur,
however, found that the newly-hatched caterpillars lived at
first in a case of silk.</p>

<p>We have repeatedly witnessed the proceedings of these
insects from the very foundation of their structures; and, at
the moment of writing this, we turned out one from the
carcase of an &ldquo;old lady moth&rdquo; (<i>Mormo maura</i>, <span class="smcap">Ochsenheim</span>)
in our cabinet, and placed it on a desk covered with green
cloth, where it might find materials for constructing another
dwelling. It wandered about for half a day before it began
its operations; but it did not, as is asserted by Bonnet, and
Kirby and Spence, &ldquo;in moving from place to place, seem to
be as much incommoded by the long hairs which surround it,
as we are by walking amongst high grass,&rdquo; nor, &ldquo;accordingly,
marching scythe in hand,&rdquo; did it, &ldquo;with its teeth, cut out a
smooth road.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_BU" id="FNanchor_BU"></a><a href="#Footnote_BU" class="fnanchor">[BU]</a> On contrary, it did not cut a single hair
till it selected one for the foundation of its intended
structure. This it cut very near the cloth, in order, we
suppose, to have it as long as possible; and placed it on a
line with its body. It then immediately cut another, and
placing it parallel to the first, bound both together with a
few threads of its own silk. The same process was repeated
with other hairs, till the little creature had made a fabric of
some thickness, and this it went on to extend till it was
large enough to cover its body; which (as is usual with
caterpillars) it employed as a model and measure for regulating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
its operations. We remarked that it made choice of
longer hairs for the outside than for the parts of the interior,
which it thought necessary to strengthen by fresh additions;
but the chamber was ultimately finished by a fine and closely-woven
tapestry of silk. We could see the progress of its
work by looking into the opening at either of the ends; for at
this stage of the structure the walls are quite opaque, and the
insect concealed. It may be thus observed to turn round, by
doubling itself and bringing its head where the tail had just
been; of course, the interior is left wide enough for this
purpose, and the centre, indeed, where it turns, is always
wider than the extremities. (J. R.)</p>

<p>When the caterpillar increases in length, it takes care to
add to the length of its house, by working in fresh hairs at
either end; and if it be shifted to stuffs of different colours,
it may be made to construct a party-coloured tissue, like a
Scotch plaid. Réaumur cut off with scissors a portion at
each end, to compel the insect to make up the deficiency.
But the caterpillar increases in thickness as well as in length,
so that, its first house becoming too narrow, it must either
enlarge it, or build a new one. It prefers the former as less
troublesome, and accomplishes its purpose &ldquo;as dexterously,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
says Bonnet, &ldquo;as any tailor, and sets to work precisely as we
should do, slitting the case on the two opposite sides, and
then adroitly inserting between them two pieces of the
requisite size. It does not, however, cut open the case from
one end to the other at once; the sides would separate too
far asunder, and the insect be left naked. It therefore first
cuts each side about half-way down, beginning sometimes at
the centre and sometimes at the end (Fig. <i>c</i>), and then, after
having filled up the fissure, proceeds to cut the remaining
half; so that, in fact, four enlargements are made, and four
separate pieces inserted. The colour of the case is always
the same as that of the stuff from which it is taken. Thus,
if its original colour be blue, and the insect, previously to
enlarging it, be put upon red cloth, the circles at the end,
and two stripes down the middle, will be red.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_BV" id="FNanchor_BV"></a><a href="#Footnote_BV" class="fnanchor">[BV]</a> Réaumur
found that they cut these enlargements in no precise order,
but sometimes continuously, and sometimes opposite each
other, indifferently.</p>

<p>The same naturalist says he never knew one leave its old
dwelling in order to build a new; though, when once ejected
by force from its house, it would never enter it again, as
some other species of caterpillars will do, but always
preferred building another. We, on the contrary, have
more than once seen them leave an old habitation. The
very caterpillar, indeed, whose history we have above given,
first took up its abode in a specimen of the ghost-moth
(<i>Hepialus humuli</i>), where, finding few suitable materials for
building, it had recourse to the cork of the drawer, with the
chips of which it made a structure almost as warm as it
would have done from wool. Whether it took offence at our
disturbing it one day, or whether it did not find sufficient
food in the body of the ghost-moth, we know not; but it left
its cork house, and travelled about eighteen inches, selected
&ldquo;the old lady,&rdquo; one of the largest insects in the drawer, and
built a new apartment, composed partly of cork as before,
and partly of bits clipt out of the moth&rsquo;s wings. (J. R.)</p>

<p>We have seen these caterpillars form their habitations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
every sort of insect, from a butterfly to a beetle; and the
soft, feathery wings of moths answer their purpose very
well: but when they fall in with such hard materials as
the musk beetle (<i>Cerambyx moschatus</i>), or the large scolopendra
of the West Indies, they find some difficulty in the
building.</p>

</div>

<p>When the structure is finished, the insect deems itself
secure to feed on the materials of the cloth or other animal
matter within its reach, provided it is dry and free from fat
or grease, which Réaumur found it would not touch. This
may probably be the origin of the practice of putting a bit of
candle with furs, &amp;c., to preserve them from the moth. For
building, it always selects the straightest and loosest pieces
of wool, but for food it prefers the shortest and most compact;
and to procure these it eats into the body of the stuff, rejecting
the pile or nap, which it necessarily cuts across at the origin,
and permits to fall, leaving it threadbare, as if it had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
much worn. It must have been this circumstance which
induced Bonnet to fancy (as we have already mentioned)
that it cuts the hairs to make itself a smooth, comfortable
path to walk upon. It would be equally correct to say that
an ox or a sheep dislikes walking amongst long grass, and
therefore eats it down in order to clear the way.</p>

<p>[There is a little insect closely allied to these moths,
which does a vast amount of harm to the bee-combs. This
is the honeycomb-moth, of which there are in England two
species, both belonging to the genus Galleria. This little
creature is continually trying to make its way into the hives,
and is as continually opposed by the bees, who instinctively
know their enemy. If it once slips past the guards, the
unfortunate bees are doomed to lose a considerable amount
of their stored treasures, and have sometimes been so worried
that they have been obliged to leave the hive altogether.</p>

<p>As soon as it can hide itself in an empty cell&mdash;an easy
matter enough for so tiny a moth, which harmonizes exactly
in colour with the bee-combs&mdash;it proceeds to lay its eggs, and,
having discharged its office, dies. The eggs soon hatch
into little grubs and caterpillars with very hard horny heads
and soft bodies. As soon as they come into the dark world
of the hive, they begin to eat their way through the combs,
spinning the while a tunnel of silk, which entirely protects
them from the stings of the bees. They can traverse these
tunnels with tolerable speed, so that the bees do not know
where to find their enemies; and if perchance they should
discover one of them at the mouth of its burrow, the hard,
horny head is all that is visible, and against its polished
surface the sting of the bee is useless. The rapidity with
which they drive the silken tubes through the comb is really
marvellous; and even if they get among a collection of
empty bee-combs, they make as much havoc as if they were
bred in the hive from which the combs were taken.</p>

<p>In the accompanying illustration are seen figures of the
two species of honey-moths, together with their tunnels. The
species may be easily distinguished by the shape of the
wings, <i>Galleria alvearia</i> having, as seen at Figs. <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, the ends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
of its wings rounded, and <i>Galleria cereana</i> having them
squared.</p>

<p>Some moths, also belonging to the vast Family Tineidæ,
do much damage to grain, and have also the habit of spinning
silken tissues as they eat their way through the grain. One
of them is more plentiful on the Continent than in England,
but is known in this country by the name of the mottled
woollen moth (<i>Tinea granella</i>)].</p>

<p>The caterpillar, which is smooth and white, ties together
with silk several grains of wheat, barley, rye, or oats, weaving
a gallery between them, from which it projects its head while
feeding; the grains, as Réaumur remarks, being prevented
from rolling or slipping by the silk which unites them. He
justly ridicules the absurd notion of its filing off the outer
skin of the wheat by rubbing upon it with its body, the
latter being the softer of the two, and he disproved, by
experiment, Leeuwenhoeck&rsquo;s assertion that it will also feed
on woollen cloth. It is from the end of May till the
beginning of July that the moths, which are of a silvery
grey, spotted with brown, appear and lay their eggs in
granaries.</p>

<p>The caterpillar of another still more singular grain-moth
(<i>Tinea Hordei</i>, <span class="smcap">Kirby</span> and <span class="smcap">Spence</span>) proves sometimes very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
destructive of granaries. The mother-moth, in May or
June, lays about twenty or more eggs on a grain of barley
or wheat; and when the caterpillars are hatched they disperse,
each selecting a single grain. M. Réaumur imagines that
sanguinary wars must sometimes arise, in cases of preoccupancy,
a single grain of barley being a rich heritage for
one of these tiny insects; but he confesses he never saw such
contests. When the caterpillar has eaten its way into the
interior of the grain, it feeds on the farina, taking care not to
gnaw the skin nor even to throw out its excrements, so that
except the little hole, scarcely discernible, the grain appears
quite sound. When it has eaten all the farina, it spins
itself a case of silk within the now hollow grain, and changes
to a pupa in November.</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Tent-making Caterpillars.</p>

<p>The caterpillars of a family of small moths (<i>Tineidæ</i>),
which feed on the leaves of various trees, such as the
hawthorn, the elm, the oak, and most fruit-trees, particularly
the pear, form habitations which are exceedingly ingenious
and elegant. They are so very minute that they require
close inspection to discover them; and to the cursory
observer, unacquainted with their habits, they will appear
more like the withered leaf-scales of the tree, thrown off when
the buds expand, than artificial structures made by insects.
It is only, indeed, by seeing them move about upon the
leaves, that we discover they are inhabited by a living tenant,
who carries them as the snail does its shell.</p>

<p>These tents are from a quarter of an inch to an inch in
length, and usually about the breadth of an oat-straw. That
they are of the colour of a withered leaf is not surprising;
for they are actually composed of a piece of leaf; not, however,
cut out from the whole thickness, but artfully separated
from the upper layer, as a person might separate one of the
leaves of paper from a sheet of pasteboard.</p>

<p>The tents of this class of caterpillars, which are found on
the elm, the alder, and other trees with serrated leaves, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
much in the shape of a minute goldfish. They are convex
on the back, where the indentations of the leaf out of which
they have been cut add to the resemblance, by appearing like
the dorsal fins of the fish. By depriving one of those caterpillars
common on the hawthorn of its tents, for the sake of
experiment, we put it under the necessity of making another;
for, as Pliny remarks of the clothes-moth, they will rather
die of hunger than feed unprotected. When we placed it on
a fresh hawthorn leaf, it repeatedly examined every part of
it, as if seeking for its lost tent, though, when this was put
in its way, it would not again enter it; but, after some delay,
commenced a new one. (J. R.)</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 303px;">
<img src="images/244.png" width="303" height="151" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">A Caterpillar&rsquo;s tent upon a leaf of the elm.&mdash;<br />
<i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, The part of the leaf from which the<br />
tent has been cut out; <i>b</i>, the tent itself.</span>
</div>

<p>For this purpose, it began to eat through one of the two
outer membranes which compose the leaf and enclose the
pulp (<i>parenchyma</i>), some of which, also, it devoured, and
then thrust the hinder part of its body into the perforation.
The cavity, however, which it had formed, being yet too
small for its reception, it immediately resumed the task of
making it larger. By continuing to gnaw into the pulp
<i>between</i> the membranes of the leaf (for it took the greatest
care not to puncture or injure the membranes themselves), it
soon succeeded in mining out a gallery rather larger than
was sufficient to contain its body. We perceived that it did
not throw out as rubbish the pulp it dug into, but devoured
it as food&mdash;a circumstance not the least remarkable in its
proceedings.</p>

<p>As the two membranes of leaf thus deprived of the
enclosed pulp appeared white and transparent, every movement
of the insect within could be distinctly seen; and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
was not a little interesting to watch its ingenious operations
while it was making its tent from the membranes prepared
as we have just described. These, as Réaumur has remarked,
are in fact to the insect like a piece of cloth in the
hands of a tailor; and no tailor could cut out a shape with
more neatness and dexterity than this little workman does.
As the caterpillar is furnished in its mandibles with an
excellent pair of scissors, this may not appear to be a difficult
task; yet, when we examine the matter more minutely,
we find that the peculiar shape of the two extremities requires
different curvatures, and this, of course, renders the
operation no less complex, as Réaumur subjoins, than the
shaping of the pieces of cloth for a coat.<a name="FNanchor_BW" id="FNanchor_BW"></a><a href="#Footnote_BW" class="fnanchor">[BW]</a> The insect, in
fact, shapes the membranes slightly convex on one side and
concave on the other, and at one end twice as large as the
other. In the instance which we observed, beginning at the
larger end, it bent them gently on each side by pressing
them with its body thrown into a curve. We have not said
it <i>cuts</i>, but <i>shapes</i> its materials; for it must be obvious that
if the insect had cut both the membranes at this stage of its
operations, the pieces would have fallen and carried it along
with them.</p>

<p>To obviate such an accident it proceeded to join the
two edges, and secure them firmly with silk, before it made
a single incision to detach them. When it had in this
manner joined the two edges along one of the sides, it
inserted its head on the outside of the joining, first at one
end and then at the other, gnawing the fibres till that
whole side was separated. It proceeded in the same manner
with the other side, joining the edges before it cut them:
and when it arrived at the last fibre, the only remaining
support of its now finished tent, it took the precaution,
before snipping it, to moor the whole to the uncut part of
the leaf by a cable of its own silk. Consequently, when it
does cut the last nervure, it is secure from falling, and can
then travel along the leaf, carrying its tent on its back, as a
snail does its shell. (J. R.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>We have just discovered (Nov. 4th, 1829) upon the
nettle a tent of a very singular appearance, in consequence
of the materials of which it is made. The caterpillar
seems, indeed, to have proceeded exactly in the same
manner as those which we have described, mining first
between the two membranes of the leaf, and then uniting
these and cutting out his tent. But the tent itself looks
singular from being all over studded with the stinging
bristles of the nettle, and forming a no less formidable coat
of mail to the little inhabitant than the spiny hide of the
hedgehog. In feeding it does not seem to have mined into
the leaf, but to have eaten the whole of the lower membrane,
along with the entire pulp, leaving nothing but the upper
membrane untouched. (J. R.) During the summer of 1830
we discovered a very large tent which had been formed out
of a blade of grass; and another stuck all over with chips
of leaves upon the common maple.</p>

<p class="caption3 smcap">Tents of Stone-Mason Caterpillars.</p>

<p>The caterpillar of a small moth (<i>Tinea</i>) which feeds upon
the lichens growing on walls, builds for itself a moveable
tent of a very singular kind. M. de la Voye was the first
who described these insects; but though they are frequently
overlooked, from being very small, they are by no means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
uncommon on old walls. Réaumur observed them regularly
for twenty years together on the terrace-wall of the Tuileries
at Paris; and they may be found in abundance in similar
situations in this country. This accurate observer refuted
by experiment the notion of M. de la Voye that the caterpillars
fed upon the stones of the wall; but he satisfied
himself that they detached particles of the stone for the
purpose of building their tents or sheaths (<i>fourreaux</i>), as he
calls their dwellings. In order to watch their mode of
building, Réaumur gently ejected half-a-dozen of them from
their homes, and observed them detach grain after grain
from a piece of stone, binding each into the wall of their
building with silk till the cell acquired the requisite magnitude,
the whole operation taking about twenty-four hours
of continued labour. M. de la Voye mentions small granular
bodies of a greenish colour, placed irregularly on the exterior
of the structure, which he calls eggs; but we agree
with Réaumur in thinking it more probable that they are
small fragments of moss or lichen intermixed with the stone:
in fact, we have ascertained that they are so. (J. R.)</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Lichen-Tents and Caterpillars, both of their natural size and magnified.</span>
</div>

<p>When these little architects prepare for their change
into chrysalides before becoming moths, they attach their
tents securely to the stone over which they have hitherto
rambled, by spinning a strong mooring of silk, so as not
only to fill up every interstice between the main entrance
of the tent and the stone, but also weaving a close, thick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
curtain of the same material, to shut up the entire aperture.</p>

<p>It is usual for insects which form similar structures to
issue, when they assume the winged state, from the broader
end of their habitation; but our little stone-mason proceeds
in a different manner. It leaves open the apex of the cone
from the first, for the purpose of ejecting its excrements,
and latterly it enlarges this opening a little, to allow of a
free exit when it acquires wings; taking care, however,
to spin over it a canopy of silk, as a temporary protection,
which it can afterwards burst through without difficulty.
The moth itself is very much like the common clothes-moth
in form, but is of a gilded-bronze colour, and considerably
smaller.</p>

<p>In the same locality, M. de Maupertuis found a numerous
brood of small caterpillars, which employed grains of
stone, not, like the preceding, for building feeding-tents,
but for their cocoons. This caterpillar was of a brownish-grey
colour, with a white line along the back, on each side
of which were tufts of hair. The cocoons which it built
were oval, and less in size than a hazel-nut, the grains of
the stone being skilfully woven into irregular meshes of
silk.</p>

<p>In June, 1829, we found a numerous encampment of the
tent-building caterpillars described by MM. de la Voye
and Réaumur, on the brick wall of a garden at Blackheath,
Kent. (J. R.) They were so very small, however, and
so like the lichen on the wall, that had not our attention
been previously directed to their habits, we should have
considered them as portions of the wall; for not one of
them was in motion, and it was only by the neat, turbinated,
conical form in which they had constructed their
habitations that we detected them. We tried the experiment
above mentioned, of ejecting one of the caterpillars
from its tent, in order to watch its proceedings when constructing
another; but probably its haste to procure shelter,
or the artificial circumstances into which it was thrown,
influenced its operations, for it did not form so good a tent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
as the first, the texture of the walls being much slighter,
while it was more rounded at the apex, and of course not so
elegant. Réaumur found, in all his similar experiments,
that the new structure equalled the old; but most of the
trials of this kind which we have made correspond with the
inferiority which we have here recorded. The process
indeed is the same, but it seems to be done with more hurry
and less care. It may be, indeed, in some cases, that the
supply of silk necessary to unite the bits of stone, earth, or
lichen employed, is too scanty for perfecting a second
structure.</p>

<p>We remarked a very singular circumstance in the operations
of our little architect, which seems to have escaped
the minute and accurate attention of Réaumur. When it
commenced its structure, it was indispensable to lay a foundation
for the walls about to be reared; but as the tent was
to be moveable like the shell of a snail, and not stationary,
it would not have answered its end to cement the foundation
to the wall. We had foreseen this difficulty, and felt not a
little interested in discovering how it would be got over.
Accordingly, upon watching its movements with some attention,
we were soon gratified to perceive that it used its own
body as the primary support of the building. It fixed a
thread of silk upon one of its right feet, warped it over to
the corresponding left foot, and upon the thread thus
stretched between the two feet it glued grains of stone and
chips of lichen, till the wall was of the required thickness.
Upon this, as a foundation, it continued to work till it had
formed a small portion in form of a parallelogram; and
proceeding in a similar way, it was not long in making
a ring a very little wider than sufficient to admit its body.
It extended this ring in breadth, by working on the inside
only, narrowing the diameter by degrees, till it began to
take the form of a cone. The apex of this cone was not
closed up, but left as an aperture through which to eject its
excrements.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark, that one of the caterpillars which
we deprived of its tent attempted to save itself the trouble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
of building a new one, by endeavouring to unhouse one of
its neighbours. For this purpose, it got upon the outside
of the inhabited tent, and, sliding its head down to the
entrance, tried to make its way into the interior. But the
rightful owner did not choose to give up his premises so
easily, and fixed his tent down so firmly upon the table
where we had placed it, that the intruder was forced to
abandon his attempt. The instant, however, that the other
unmoored his tent and began to move about, the invader
renewed his efforts to eject him, persevering in the struggle
for several hours, but without a chance of success. At one
time we imagined that he would have accomplished his
felonious intentions; for he bound down the apex of the
tent to the table with cables of silk. But he attempted his
entrance at the wrong end. He ought to have tried the
aperture in the apex, by enlarging which a little he would
undoubtedly have made good his entrance; and as the
inhabitant could not have turned upon him for want of room,
the castle must have been surrendered. This experiment,
however, was not tried, and there was no hope for him at
the main entrance.</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Muff-shaped Tents.</p>

<p>The ingenuity of man has pressed into his service not
only the wool, the hair, and even the skins of animals, but
has most extensively searched the vegetable kingdom for
the materials of his clothing. In all this, however, he is
rivalled by the tiny inhabitants of the insect world, as we
have already seen; and we are about now to give an additional
instance of the art of a species of caterpillars which
select a warmer material for their tents than even the caterpillar
of the clothes-moth. It may have been remarked by
many who are not botanists, that the seed-catkins of the
willow become, as they ripen, covered with a species of
down or cotton, which, however, is too short in the fibre to
be advantageously employed in our manufactures. But the
caterpillars, to which we have alluded, find it well adapted
for their habitations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>The muff-looking tent in which we find these insects does
not require much trouble to construct; for the caterpillar
does not, like the clothes-moth caterpillar, join the willow-cotton
together, fibre by fibre&mdash;it is contented with the
state in which it finds it on the seed. Into this it burrows,
lines the interior with a tapestry of silk, and then detaches
the whole from the branch where it was growing, and carries
it about with it as a protection while it is feeding.<a name="FNanchor_BX" id="FNanchor_BX"></a><a href="#Footnote_BX" class="fnanchor">[BX]</a></p>

</div>

<p>An inquiring friend of Réaumur having found one of
these insects floating about in its muff-tent upon water,
concluded that they feed upon aquatic plants; but he was
soon convinced that it had only been blown down by an
accident, which must frequently happen, as willows so often
hang over water. May it not be, that the buoyant materials
of the tent were intended to furnish the little inhabitant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
with a life-boat, in which, when it chanced to be blown into
the water, it might sail safely ashore and regain its native
tree?</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Leaf-mining Caterpillars.</p>

<p>The process of mining between the two membranes of
a leaf is carried on to a farther extent by minute caterpillars
allied to the tent-makers above described. The tent-maker
never deserts his house, except when compelled, and therefore
can only mine to about half the length of his own
body; but the miners now to be considered make the mine
itself their dwelling-place, and as they eat their way, they
lengthen and enlarge their galleries. A few of these mining
caterpillars are the progeny of small weevils (<i>Curculionidæ</i>),
some of two-winged flies (<i>Diptera</i>), but the greater number
are produced from a genus of minute moth (<i>&OElig;cophora</i>,
<span class="smcap">Latr.</span>), which, when magnified, appear to be amongst the
most splendid and brilliant of Nature&rsquo;s productions, vying
even with the humming-birds and diamond-beetles of the
tropics in the rich metallic colours which bespangle their
wings. Well may Bonnet call them &ldquo;tiny miracles of
Nature,&rdquo; and regret that they are not <i>en grand</i>.<a name="FNanchor_BY" id="FNanchor_BY"></a><a href="#Footnote_BY" class="fnanchor">[BY]</a></p>

<p>There are few plants or trees whose leaves may not,
at some season of the year, be found mined by these caterpillars,
the track of whose progress appears on the upper
surface in winding lines. Let us take one of the most
common of these for an example,&mdash;that of the rose-leaf,
produced by the caterpillar of Ray&rsquo;s golden-silver spot
(<i>Argyromiges Rayella</i>? <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>), of which we have just
gathered above a dozen specimens from one rose-tree.
(J. R.)</p>

<p>It may be remarked that the winding line is black, closely
resembling the tortuous course of a river on a map,&mdash;beginning
like a small brook, and gradually increasing in breadth
as it proceeds. This representation of a river exhibits, besides,
a narrow white valley on each side of it, increasing as
it goes, till it terminates in a broad delta. The valley is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>portion of the inner leaf from which the caterpillar has
eaten the pulp (<i>parenchyma</i>), while the river itself has been
formed by the liquid <i>ejectamenta</i> of the insect, the watery
part becoming evaporated. In other species of miners,
however, the dung is hard and dry, and consequently these
only exhibit the valley without the river (see <a href="#Page_255">p. 255</a>).</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 353px;">
<img src="images/253.png" width="353" height="281" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Leaf of the Monthly Rose (<i>Rose Indica</i>), mined by Caterpillars of Argyromiges?</span>
</div>

<p>On looking at the back of the leaf, where the winding
line begins, we uniformly find the shell of the very minute egg
from which the caterpillar has been hatched, and hence
perceive that it digs into the leaf the moment it escapes from
the egg, without wandering a hair&rsquo;s-breadth from the spot; as
if afraid lest the air should visit it too roughly. The egg is,
for the most part, placed upon the mid-rib of the rose-leaf,
but sometimes on one of the larger nervures. When once it
has got within the leaf, it seems to pursue no certain direction,
sometimes working to the centre, sometimes to the
circumference, sometimes to the point, and sometimes to the
base, and even, occasionally, crossing or keeping parallel to
its own previous track.</p>

<p>The most marvellous circumstance, however, is the
minuteness of its workmanship; for though a rose-leaf is
thinner than this paper, the insect finds room to mine a
tunnel to live in, and plenty of food, without touching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the two external membranes. Let any one try with the
nicest dissecting instruments to separate the two plates of
a rose-leaf, and he will find it impossible to proceed far
without tearing one or other. The caterpillar goes still
further in minute nicety; for it may be remarked, that
its track can only be seen on the upper, and not on the
under surface of the leaf, proving that it eats as it proceeds
only half the thickness of the pulp, or that portion of
it which belongs to the upper membrane of the leaf.</p>

<p>We have found this little miner on almost every sort of
rose-tree, both wild and cultivated, including the sweet-briar,
in which, the leaf being very small, it requires nearly the
whole parenchyma to feed one caterpillar. They seem, however,
to prefer the foreign monthly rose to any of our native
species, and there are few trees of this where they may not
be discovered.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 310px;">

<span class="fig_caption">Leaf of the Dew-berry Bramble (<i>Rubus cæsius</i>), mined by Caterpillars.</span>
</div>

<p>Tunnels very analogous to the preceding may be found
upon the common bramble (<i>Rubus fruticosus</i>); and on the
holly, early in spring, one which is in form of an irregular
whitish blotch. But in the former case, the little miner
seems to proceed more regularly, always, when newly
hatched, making directly for the circumference, upon or near
which also the mother-moth deposits her egg, and winding
along for half the extent of the leaf close upon the edge,
following, in some cases, the very indentations formed by
the terminating nervures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>The bramble-leaf miner seems also to differ from that
of the rose-leaf, by eating the pulp both from the upper and
under surface, at least the track is equally distinct above
and below; yet this may arise from the different consistence
of the leaf pulp, that in the rose being firm, while that of
the bramble is soft and puffy.</p>

<p>On the leaves of the common primrose (<i>Primula veris</i>), as
well as on the garden variety of it, the polyanthus, one of
those mining caterpillars may very frequently be found. It
is, however, considerably different from the preceding, for
there is no black trace&mdash;no river to the valley which it
excavates: its ejectamenta, being small and solid, are seen,
when the leaf is dried, in little black points like grains of
sand. This miner also seems more partial than the preceding
to the mid-rib and its vicinity, in consequence of
which its path is seldom so tortuous, and often appears at its
extremity to terminate in an area comparatively extensive,
arising from its recrossing its previous tracks. (J. R.)</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Leaf of the Primrose (<i>Primula veris</i>), mined by a Caterpillar.</span>
</div>

<p>Swammerdam describes a mining caterpillar which he
found on the leaves of the alder, though it did not,
like those we have just described, excavate a winding
gallery; it kept upon the same spot, and formed only an
irregular area. A moth was produced from this, whose
upper wings, he says, &ldquo;shone and glittered most gloriously
with crescents of gold, silver, and brown, surrounded by
borders of delicate black.&rdquo; Another area miner which he
found on the leaves of willows, as many as seventeen on one
leaf, producing what appeared to be rusty spots, was metamorphosed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
into a very minute weevil (<i>Curculio Rhionoc.</i>).
He says he has been informed that, in warm climates, worms
an inch long are found in leaves, and adds, with great
simplicity, &ldquo;on these many fine experiments might have been
made, if the inhabitants had not laboured under the cursed
thirst of gold.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_BZ" id="FNanchor_BZ"></a><a href="#Footnote_BZ" class="fnanchor">[BZ]</a></p>

<p>The vine-leaf miner, when about to construct its cocoon,
cuts, from the termination of its gallery, two pieces of the
membrane of the leaf, deprived of their pulp, in a similar
manner to the tent-makers described above, uniting them and
lining them with silk. This she carries to some distance
before she lays herself up to undergo her change. Her
mode of walking under her burthen is peculiar, for, not contented
with the security of a single thread of silk, she forms,
as Bonnet says, &ldquo;little mountains (<i>monticules</i>) of silk, from
distance to distance, and seizing one of these with her teeth,
drags herself forward, and makes it a scaffolding from which
she can build another.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_CA" id="FNanchor_CA"></a><a href="#Footnote_CA" class="fnanchor">[CA]</a> Some of the miners, however,
do not leave their galleries, but undergo their transformations
there, taking the precaution to mine a cell, not in the
upper, but in the under surface; others only shift to another
portion of the leaf.</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Social Leaf-Miners.</p>

<p>The preceding descriptions apply to caterpillars who
construct their mines in solitude, there being seldom more
than one on a leaf or leaflet, unless when two mother-flies
happen to lay their eggs on the same leaf; but there are
others, such as the miners of the leaves of the henbane (<i>Hyoscyamus
niger</i>), which excavate a common area in concert&mdash;from
four to eight forming a colony. These are very like
flesh-maggots, being larger than the common miners; the
leaves of this plant, from being thick and juicy, giving them
space to work and plenty to eat.</p>

<p>Most of the solitary leaf-miners either cannot or will not
construct a new mine, if ejected by an experimenter from
the old, as we have frequently proved; but this is not the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
case with the social miners of the henbane-leaf. Bonnet
ejected one of these, and watched it with his glass till it
commenced a new tunnel, which it also enlarged with
great expedition; and in order to verify the assertion of
Réaumur, that they neither endeavour nor fear to meet one
another, he introduced a second. Neither of them manifested
any knowledge of the other&rsquo;s contiguity, but both
worked hard at the gallery, as did a third and a fourth which
he afterwards introduced; for though they seemed uneasy,
they never attacked one another, as the solitary ones often do
when they meet.<a name="FNanchor_CB" id="FNanchor_CB"></a><a href="#Footnote_CB" class="fnanchor">[CB]</a></p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Bark-mining Caterpillars.</p>

<p>A very different order of mining caterpillars are the
progeny of various beetles, which excavate their galleries in
the soft inner bark of trees, or between it and the young
wood (<i>alburnum</i>). Some of these, though small, commit
extensive ravages, as may readily be conceived when we are
told that as many as eighty thousand are occasionally found
on one tree. In 1783 the trees thus destroyed by the printer-beetle
(<i>Tomicus typographus</i>, <span class="smcap">Latr.</span>), so called from its
tracks resembling letters, amounted to above a million and a
half in the Hartz forest. It appears there periodically, and
confines its ravages to the fir. This insect is said to have
been found in the neighbourhood of London.</p>

<p>On taking off the bark of decaying poplars and willows, we
have frequently met with the tracks of a miner of this order,
extending in tortuous pathways, about a quarter of an inch
broad, for several feet and even yards in length. The excavation
is not circular, but a compressed oval, and crammed
throughout with a dark-coloured substance like sawdust&mdash;the
excrement no doubt of the little miner, who is thereby
protected from the attacks of <i>Staphylinidæ</i>, and other predaceous
insects from behind. But though we have found a
great number of these subcortical tracks, we have never
discovered one of the miners, though they are very probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
the grubs of the pretty musk-beetle (<i>Cerambyx moschatus</i>),
which are so abundant in the neighbourhood of the trees in
question, that the very air in summer is perfumed with their
odour. (J. R.)</p>

<p>[Mr. Rennie is undoubtedly right in his suggestion. I
have found similar holes in old willow trees, and have traced
them throughout their varied ramifications. They contain
the larvæ and pupæ of the musk-beetle, some of which may be
seen in the Museum at Oxford. On these trees, which mostly
grow along the banks of the Cherwell, the perfect beetle was
so abundant that it might be taken in any number, and, as
described by Mr. Rennie, the air was perfumed with its powerful
and agreeable odour. So strong is the scent of this
beetle, that I have known it adhere to gloves after the lapse
of many weeks, and I have often caught the scent when passing
along the road, and merely by the aid of the nostrils
discovered the insect.</p>

<p>On account of the vast number of carpenter-beetles, it is
impossible to notice more than a few of them, and we will
therefore select some of the most conspicuous. One of them,
belonging to the genus <i>Ptilinus</i>, is very familiar to us as boring
into wooden furniture, and producing the effect which is
popularly called &ldquo;worm-eaten.&rdquo; Fortunately, the little creatures
can be easily ejected, and the wood rendered free of them
ever afterwards. All that is needed is to take a syringe with
a very fine aperture&mdash;an injecting syringe is the best&mdash;and by
its aid to force into the holes a solution of corrosive sublimate
in spirits of wine&mdash;say a large teaspoonful of the powdered salt
to a pint of spirits. The rapidity with which the poisoned
spirit permeates the wood is wonderful, and in a short time it
may be seen oozing out of twenty or thirty holes at once. This
solution is peculiarly effective, as it kills all the insects, destroys
every egg that it touches, and renders the wood poisonous
to the grubs that happen to escape. I used to be greatly
plagued with the Ptilinus among my ethnological collection,
until I tried the corrosive sublimate, and ever since my
spears, bows and arrows, and clubs have remained intact.</p>

<p>Another troublesome insect is the <i>Scolytus destructor</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
which makes its radiating tunnels between the bark and the
tree. Whole forests have been destroyed by this voracious
little beetle, the bark having been completely detached, and
the tree necessarily killed. The habits of this beetle are
well described in the following passage.]</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 472px;">
<img src="images/259.png" width="472" height="435" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Bark mined in rays by beetle-grubs.</span>
</div>

<p>We have frequently observed a very remarkable instinct
in the grubs of a species of beetle (<i>Scolytus destructor</i>,
<span class="smcap">Geoffroy</span>), which lives under the dead bark of trees. The
mother insect, as is usual with beetles, deposits her eggs in
a patch or cluster in a chink or hole in the bark; and when
the brood is hatched, they begin feeding on the bark
which had formed their cradle. There is, of course, nothing
wonderful in their eating the food selected by their mother;
but it appears that, like the caterpillars of the clothes-moth,
and the tent insects, they cannot feed except under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
cover. They dig, therefore, long tubular galleries between
the bark and the wood; and, in order not to interfere with
the <i>runs</i> of their brethren, they branch off from the place of
hatching like rays from the centre of a circle: though these
are not always in a right line, yet, however near they may
approach to the contiguous ones, none of them ever break
into each other&rsquo;s premises. We cannot but admire the
remarkable instinct implanted in these grubs by their
Creator; which guides them thus in lines diverging farther
and farther as they increase in size, so that they are prevented
from interfering with the comforts of one another.</p>

<p>[We now come to one or two of the beetles which bore
deeply into the very wood of the trees. As a rule, the
musk-beetle keeps rather towards the exterior of the tree,
but there are many that are not so cautious, and which
besides damage the tree additionally by nibbling a quantity
of chips, wherewith they strengthen their cocoons. We will
first take the two insects which are shown in the accompanying
illustration. That on the right hand is a species of
weevil, or Curculio, and is an undescribed species belonging
to the genus Rhyncophorus. It is a native of Australia. The
insect and its cocoon are drawn one third less than their
real size. The colour of the beetle is warm chestnut brown,
and the bold marks on the thorax are jet black. In its
larval state it burrows into the palm-trees, and when about
to assume the pupal condition it makes the remarkable
cocoon which is figured. Generally, these wooden cocoons
are made of little chips which are bitten from the wood, and
woven together with silk. This cocoon, however, is made of
long fibres, which are torn rather than bitten, and are so
long that one of them will sometimes encircle the cell three
times, making an average length of nine inches. It is
tolerably compact in structure, and the colour is pale brown.</p>

<p>On the left hand is an opened cocoon of an English beetle
belonging to the genus Rhagium. Like the last-mentioned
insect, the Rhagium prefers long fibres to short chips,
though it does not use them of such a length as the Rhyncophorus.
The cocoon is generally made between the bark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
and the wood, from the latter of which the fibres are torn.
In consequence of the mode of structure, the cocoon is pale
straw colour, while the hollow in which it rests is quite dark.</p>

<p>All entomologists are familiar with the pretty little wasp-beetle
(<i>Clytus arietis</i>), which derives its popular name from
the wasp-like colours of its body. In the larval state it is
one of the carpenter-grubs, and may be found in posts, fir-trees,
and similar localities. In this country, although
plentiful, it is not numerous enough to do much harm; but
in Ceylon, a closely-allied species is one of the pests of the
island. It is popularly known by the title of coffee-borer,
from its habit of boring into the stems of the coffee-plant.
The landowner looks with absolute horror on this
pretty but destructive insect, and would pay a heavy sum
annually to any one who would undertake to extirpate the
tiny foe. Whole plantations have been swept off by it, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
up to the present time no remedy has had more than a
temporary and partial success.]</p>

<p>Another capricorn beetle of this family is no less destructive
to bark in its perfect state than the above are when grubs,
as from its habit of eating round a tree, it cuts the course of
the returning sap, and destroys it.</p>

<p>[The late Mr. Waterton once showed me a stout branch
which had fallen on his head while he was standing under a
tree, the branch having been cut completely through by the
jaws of some large longicorn beetle. The mode in which the
insect had severed the branch was exactly like that which is
practised by the beaver when it cuts down a tree.</p>

<p>The burrows and cocoons of two other species of Cerambyx
are shown in the accompanying illustration, and in both
cases may be seen the provision which is made for the exit
of the beetle after it has attained the perfect condition. The
double burrow of the left is that of <i>Cerambyx carcharias</i>, and
those on the right-hand figure are the habitations of <i>Cerambyx
populneus</i>. The reader will see how these insects cut up the
wood of the branch, and can well understand the infinite
mischief which can be done to a coffee plantation by the
Clytus.</p>

<p>The last wood-boring beetle which will be mentioned is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
the stag-beetle of our own country. In the larval state this
insect resides in tree trunks, mostly towards the roots, and
therefore escapes observation more successfully than would
be the case if it inhabited a higher portion of the tree.
When full-grown, the larva is of enormous size, and the hole
which it bores is necessarily of corresponding dimensions. In
some parts of England, the larvæ are popularly called &ldquo;Joe
Bassetts,&rdquo; and are said to turn into &ldquo;Pincher Bobs.&rdquo; The
latter title is a very appropriate one, as any one can testify
who has allowed a fine male stag-beetle to grip his finger
between its jaws. As to the Joe Bassett, it is simply a local
name.]</p>

<p class="caption2">STRUCTURES OF GRASSHOPPERS, CRICKETS, AND BEETLES.</p>


<p>Grasshoppers, locusts, crickets, and beetles are, in
many respects, no less interesting than the insects
whose architectural proceedings we have already detailed.
They do not, indeed, build any edifice for the accommodation
of themselves or their progeny; but most, if not all of them,
excavate retreats in walls or in the ground.</p>

<p>The house-cricket (<i>Acheta domestica</i>) is well known for its
habit of picking out the mortar of ovens and kitchen fire-places,
where it not only enjoys warmth, but can procure
abundance of food. It is usually supposed that it feeds on
bread. M. Latreille says it only eats insects, and it certainly
thrives well in houses infested by the cockroach; but we
have also known it eat and destroy lamb&rsquo;s-wool stockings,
and other woolen stuffs, hung near a fire to dry. It is
evidently not fond of hard labour, but prefers those places
where the mortar is already loosened, or at least is new, soft,
and easily scooped out; and in this way it will dig covert
ways from room to room. In summer, crickets often make
excursions from the house to the neighbouring fields, and
dwell in the crevices of rubbish, or the cracks made in the
ground by dry weather, where they chirp as merrily as in
the snuggest chimney-corner. Whether they ever dig
retreats in such circumstances we have not ascertained:
though it is not improbable they may do so for the purpose
of making nests. M. Bory St. Vincent tells us that the
Spaniards are so fond of crickets that they keep them in
cages like singing birds.<a name="FNanchor_CC" id="FNanchor_CC"></a><a href="#Footnote_CC" class="fnanchor">[CC]</a></p>

<span class="fig_caption">The Mole-Cricket, with a separate outline of one of its hands.</span>
</div>

<p class="caption3 smcap">The Mole-Cricket.</p>

<p>The insect, called, from its similarity of habits to the
mole, the mole-cricket (<i>Gryllotalpa vulgaris</i>, <span class="smcap">Latr.</span>), is but too
well known in gardens, corn-fields, and the moist banks of
rivers and ponds, in some parts of England, such as Wiltshire
and Hampshire, though it is comparatively rare or
unknown in others. It burrows in the ground, and forms
extensive galleries similar to those of the mole, though
smaller; and these may always be recognized by a slightly
elevated ridge of mould: for the insect does not throw up
the earth in hillocks like the mole, but gradually, as it digs
along, in the manner of the field-mouse. In this way it
commits great ravages, in hotbeds and in gardens, upon peas,
young cabbages, and other vegetables, the roots of which it
is said to devour. It is not improbable, we think, that, like
its congener, the house-cricket, it may also prey upon underground
insects, and undermine the plants to get at them, as
the mole has been proved to do. Mr Gould, indeed, fed a
mole-cricket for several months upon ants.</p>

<p>The structure of the mole-cricket&rsquo;s arms and hands (if we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
may call them so) is admirably adapted for these operations,
being both very strong, and moved by a peculiar apparatus
of muscles. The breast is formed of a thick, hard, horny
substance, which is further strengthened within by a double
framework of strong gristle, in front of the extremities of
which the shoulder-blades of the arms are firmly jointed:
a structure evidently intended to prevent the breast from
being injured by the powerful action of the muscles of the
arms in digging. The arms themselves are strong and
broad, and the hand is furnished with four large sharp
claws, pointed somewhat obliquely outwards, this being the
direction in which it digs, throwing the earth on each side
of its course. So strongly indeed does it throw out its arms,
that we find it can thus easily support its own weight when
held between the finger and thumb, as we have tried upon
half-a-dozen of the living insects now in our possession.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Nest of the Mole-Cricket.</span>
</div>

<p>The nest which the female constructs for her eggs, in the
beginning of May, is well worthy of attention. The Rev.
Mr. White, of Selborne, tells us that a gardener, at a house
where he was on a visit, while mowing grass by the side of
a canal, chanced to strike his scythe too deep, and pared off
a large piece of turf, laying open to view an interesting scene
of domestic economy. There was a pretty chamber dug in
the clay, of the form and about the dimensions it would have
had if moulded by an egg, the walls being neatly smoothed
and polished. In this little cell were deposited about a
hundred eggs, of the size and form of caraway comfits, and
of a dull tarnished white colour. The eggs were not very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
deep, but just under a little heap of fresh mould, and within
the influence of the sun&rsquo;s heat.<a name="FNanchor_CD" id="FNanchor_CD"></a><a href="#Footnote_CD" class="fnanchor">[CD]</a> The dull tarnished white
colour, however, scarcely agrees with a parcel of these eggs
now before us, which are translucent, gelatinous, and
greenish.</p>

<p>Like the eggs and young of other insects, however, those
of the mole-cricket are exposed to depredation, and particularly
to the ravages of a black beetle which burrows in
similar localities. The mother insect, accordingly, does not
think her nest secure till she has defended it, like a fortified
town, with labyrinths, intrenchments, ramparts, and covert
ways. In some part of these out-works she stations herself
as an advanced guard, and when the beetle ventures within
her circumvallations, she pounces upon him and kills him.</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">The Field-Cricket.</p>

<p>Another insect of this family, the field-cricket (<i>Acheta
campestris</i>), also forms burrows in the ground, in which it
lodges all day, and comes out chiefly about sunset to pipe its
evening song. It is so very shy and cautious, however,
that it is by no means easy to discover either the insect or
its burrow. &ldquo;The children in France amuse themselves
with hunting after the field-cricket; they put into its hole
an ant fastened by a long hair, and as they draw it out the
cricket does not fail to pursue it, and issue from its retreat.
Pliny informs us it might be captured in a much more
expeditious and easy manner. If, for instance, a small and
slender piece of stick were to be thrust into the burrow, the
insect, he says, would immediately get upon it for the purpose
of demanding the occasion of the intrusion: whence
arose the proverb, <i>stultior grillo</i> (more foolish than a cricket),
applied to one who, upon light grounds, provokes his enemy,
and falls into the snares which might have been laid to
entrap him.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_CE" id="FNanchor_CE"></a><a href="#Footnote_CE" class="fnanchor">[CE]</a></p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. White, who attentively studied their habits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
and manners, at first made an attempt to dig them out with
a spade, but without any great success; for either the bottom
of the hole was inaccessible, from its terminating under a
large stone, or else in breaking up the ground the poor
creature was inadvertently squeezed to death. Out of one
thus bruised a great number of eggs were taken, which were
long and narrow, of a yellow colour, and covered with a very
tough skin. More gentle means were then used, and these
proved successful. A pliant stalk of grass, gently insinuated
into the caverns, will probe their windings to the bottom, and
bring out the inhabitant; and thus the humane inquirer may
gratify his curiosity without injuring the object of it.</p>

<p>When the males meet, they sometimes fight very fiercely,
as Mr. White found by some that he put into the crevices of
a dry stone wall, where he wished to have them settle. For
though they seemed distressed by being taken out of their
knowledge, yet the first that got possession of the chinks
seized on all the others that were obtruded upon him with
his large row of serrated fangs. With their strong jaws,
toothed like the shears of a lobster&rsquo;s claws, they perforate
and round their curious regular cells, having no fore-claws
to dig with, like the mole-cricket. When taken into the
hand, they never attempt to defend themselves, though
armed with such formidable weapons. Of such herbs as
grow about the mouths of their burrows they eat indiscriminately,
and never in the day-time seem to stir more than
two or three inches from home. Sitting in the entrance
of their caverns, they chirp all night as well as day, from
the middle of the month of May to the middle of July. In
hot weather, when they are most vigorous, they make the
hills echo; and, in the more still hours of darkness, may be
heard to a very considerable distance. &ldquo;Not many summers
ago,&rdquo; says Mr. White, "I endeavoured to transplant a
colony of these insects to the terrace in my garden, by boring
deep holes in the sloping turf. The new inhabitants stayed
some time, and fed and sang; but they wandered away by
degrees, and were heard at a greater distance every morning;
so it appears that on this emergency they made use of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
wings in attempting to return to the spot from which they
were taken."<a name="FNanchor_CF" id="FNanchor_CF"></a><a href="#Footnote_CF" class="fnanchor">[CF]</a> The manner in which these insects lay
their eggs is represented in the following figure, which is
that of an insect nearly allied to the crickets, though of a
different genus.</p>

The usual position of the ovipositor is represented by dots.</span>
</div>

<p>A more laborious task is performed by an insect by no
means uncommon in Britain, the burying beetle (<i>Necrophorus
vespillo</i>), which may be easily recognized by its longish
body, of a black colour, with two broad and irregularly
indented bands of yellowish brown. A foreign naturalist,
M. Gleditsch, gives a very interesting account of its industry.
He had "often remarked that dead moles, when
laid upon the ground, especially if upon loose earth, were
almost sure to disappear in the course of two or three days,
often of twelve hours. To ascertain the cause, he placed a
mole upon one of the beds in his garden. It had vanished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
by the third morning; and on digging where it had been
laid, he found it buried to the depth of three inches, and
under it four beetles, which seemed to have been the agents in
this singular inhumation. Not perceiving anything particular
in the mole, he buried it again; and on examining it
at the end of six days, he found it swarming with maggots,
apparently the issue of the beetles, which M. Gleditsch now
naturally concluded had buried the carcase for the food of
their future young. To determine these points more clearly,
he put four of these insects into a glass vessel, half filled
with earth and properly secured, and upon the surface of
the earth two frogs. In less than twelve hours one of the
frogs was interred by two of the beetles; the other two ran
about the whole day, as if busied in measuring the dimensions
of the remaining corpse, which on the third day was
also found buried. He then introduced a dead linnet. A
pair of the beetles were soon engaged upon the bird. They
began their operations by pushing out the earth from under
the body, so as to form a cavity for its reception; and it
was curious to see the efforts which the beetles made, by
dragging at the feathers of the bird from below, to pull it
into its grave. The male, having driven the female away,
continued the work alone for five hours. He lifted up the
bird, changed its place, turned it, and arranged it in the
grave, and from time to time came out of the hole, mounted
upon it, and trod it under foot, and then retired below, and
pulled it down. At length, apparently wearied with this
uninterrupted labour, it came forth, and leaned its head upon
the earth beside the bird, without the smallest motion, as if to
rest itself, for a full hour, when it again crept under the
earth. The next day, in the morning, the bird was an inch
and a half under ground, and the trench remained open the
whole day, the corpse seeming as if laid out upon a bier,
surrounded with a rampart of mould. In the evening it
had sunk half an inch lower, and in another day the work
was completed, and the bird covered. M. Gleditsch continued
to add other small dead animals, which were all
sooner or later buried; and the result of his experiment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
was, that in fifty days four beetles had interred, in the very
small space of earth allotted to them, twelve carcases, viz.,
four frogs, three small birds, two fishes, one mole, and two
grasshoppers, besides the entrails of a fish, and two morsels
of the lungs of an ox. In another experiment, a single
beetle buried a mole, forty times its own bulk and weight, in
two days."<a name="FNanchor_CG" id="FNanchor_CG"></a><a href="#Footnote_CG" class="fnanchor">[CG]</a></p>

<p>In the summer of 1826, we found on Putney Heath, in
Surrey, four of these beetles, hard at work in burying a dead
crow, precisely in the manner described by M. Gleditsch.
(J. R.)</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Dung-Beetle.</p>

<p>A still more common British insect, the dorr, clock, or
dung-beetle (<i>Geotrupes stercorarius</i>), uses different materials
for burying along with its eggs. &ldquo;It digs,&rdquo; to use the
words of Kirby and Spence, &ldquo;a deep cylindrical hole, and
carrying down a mass of the dung to the bottom, in it
deposits its eggs. And many of the species of the genus
<i>Ateuchus</i> roll together wet dung into round pellets, deposit
an egg in the midst of each, and when dry push them backwards,
by their hind feet, to holes of the surprising depth of
three feet, which they have previously dug for their reception,
and which are often several yards distant. The
attention of these insects to their eggs is so remarkable, that
it was observed in the earliest ages, and is mentioned by
ancient writers, but with the addition of many fables; as that
they were all of the male sex; that they became young again
every year; and that they rolled the pellets containing their
eggs from sunrise to sunset every day, for twenty-eight days,
without intermission.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_CH" id="FNanchor_CH"></a><a href="#Footnote_CH" class="fnanchor">[CH]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;We frequently notice in our evening walks,&rdquo; says Mr.
Knapp, "the murmuring passage, and are often stricken by
the heedless flight of the great dorr-beetle (<i>Geotrupes stercorarius</i>),
clocks, as the boys call them. But this evening my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
attention was called to them in particular, by the constant
passing of such a number as to constitute something like a
little stream; and I was led to search into the object of their
direct flight, as in general it is irregular and seemingly
inquisitive. I soon found that they dropped on some recent
nuisance: but what powers of perception must these creatures
possess, drawn from all distances and directions by the
very little fetor which, in such a calm evening, could be
diffused around, and by what inconceivable means could
odours reach, this beetle in such a manner as to rouse so
inert an insect into action! But it is appointed one of the
great scavengers of the earth, and marvellously endowed
with powers of sensation, and means of effecting this purpose
of its being. Exquisitely fabricated as it is to receive
impressions, yet probably it is not more highly gifted than
any of the other innumerable creatures that wing their way
around us, or creep about our paths, though by this one
perceptible faculty, thus &lsquo;dimly seen,&rsquo; it excites our wonder
and surprise. How wondrous then the whole!</p>

<p>"The perfect cleanliness of these creatures is a very
notable circumstance, when we consider that nearly their
whole lives are passed in burrowing in the earth, and removing
nuisances; yet such is the admirable polish of their
coating and limbs, that we very seldom find any soil adhering
to them. The meloe, and some of the scarabæi, upon
first emerging from their winter&rsquo;s retreat, are commonly
found with earth clinging to them; but the removal of this
is one of the first operations of the creature; and all the
beetle race, the chief occupation of which is crawling about
the soil, and such dirty employs, are, notwithstanding,
remarkable for the glossiness of their covering, and freedom
from defilements of any kind. But purity of vesture seems
to be a principal precept of Nature, and observable throughout
creation. Fishes, from the nature of the element in
which they reside, can contract but little impurity. Birds
are unceasingly attentive to neatness and lustration of their
plumage. All the slug race, though covered with slimy
matter calculated to collect extraneous things, and reptiles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
are perfectly free from soil. The fur and hair of beasts, in
a state of liberty and health, is never filthy or sullied with
dirt. Some birds roll themselves in dust, and, occasionally,
particular beasts cover themselves with mire; but this is not
from any liking or inclination for such things, but to free
themselves from annoyances, or to prevent the bites of insects.
Whether birds in preening, and beasts in dressing themselves,
be directed by any instinctive faculty, we know not; but
they evidently derive pleasure from the operation, and thus
this feeling of enjoyment, even if the sole motive, becomes to
them an essential source of comfort and of health."<a name="FNanchor_CI" id="FNanchor_CI"></a><a href="#Footnote_CI" class="fnanchor">[CI]</a></p>

<p>The rose or green chafer (<i>Cetonia aurata</i>), which is one of
our prettiest native insects, is one of the burrowers, and, for
the purpose of depositing her eggs, digs, about the middle of
June, into soft light ground. When she is seen at this
operation, with her broad and delicate wings folded up in
their shining green cases, speckled with white, it could
hardly be imagined that she had but just descended from the
air, or dropped down from some neighbouring rose.</p>

<p class="tb_stars">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>The proceedings of the Tumble-Dung Beetle of America
(<i>Scarabæus pilularius</i>, <span class="smcap">Linn.</span>) are described in a very interesting
manner by Catesby, in his &lsquo;Carolina.&rsquo; &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; says
he, "attentively admired their industry, and mutual assisting
of each other in rolling their globular balls from the place
where they made them to that of their interment, which is
usually the distance of some yards, more or less. This they
perform breech foremost, by raising their hind parts, and
forcing along the ball with their hind feet. Two or three of
them are sometimes engaged in trundling one ball, which,
from meeting with impediments on account of the unevenness
of the ground, is sometimes deserted by them. It is, however,
attempted by others with success, unless it happens to
roll into some deep hollow or chink, where they are constrained
to leave it; but they continue their work by rolling
off the next ball that comes in their way. None of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
seem to know their own balls, but an equal care for the
whole appears to affect all the community. They form these
pellets while the dung remains moist, and leave them to
harden in the sun before they attempt to roll them. In their
moving of them from place to place, both they and the balls
may frequently be seen tumbling about the little eminences
that are in their way. They are not, however, easily discouraged;
and, by repeating their attempts, usually surmount
the difficulties."</p>

<p>He further informs us that they &ldquo;find out their subsistence
by the excellency of their noses, which direct them in their
flight to newly-fallen dung, on which they immediately go to
work, tempering it with a proper mixture of earth. So intent
are they always upon their employment, that, though handled
or otherwise interrupted, they are not to be deterred, but
immediately, on being freed, persist in their work without
any apprehension of danger. They are said to be so exceedingly
strong and active as to move about, with the greatest
ease, things that are many times their own weight. Dr.
Brichell was supping one evening in a planter&rsquo;s house of
North Carolina, when two of them were conveyed, without
his knowledge, under the candlesticks. A few blows were
struck on the table, and, to his great surprise, the candlesticks
began to move about, apparently without any agency;
and his surprise was not much lessened when, on taking one
of them up, he discovered that it was only a chafer that
moved it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We have often found the necklace-beetle (<i>Carabus monilis</i>)
inhabiting a chamber dug out in the earth of a garden, just
sufficient to contain its body, and carefully smoothed and
polished. From the form of this little nest, it would seem
as if it were constructed, not by digging out the earth and
removing it, but chiefly by the insect pushing its body
forcibly against the walls. The beetles which we have
found nestling in this manner have been all males; and
therefore it cannot be intended for a breeding-cell; for male
insects are never, we believe, sufficiently generous to their
mates to assist them in such labours. The beetle in question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
appears to be partial to celery trenches (J. R.); probably
from the loose earth of which they are composed yielding,
without much difficulty, to the pressure of its body.</p>

<p>[Many of the subterranean larvæ which are turned up by
the spade or the plough are the imperfect conditions of
earth-burrowing beetles, and many of them are among the
most insidious pests of the farmer, their ravages being all the
more dangerous because they are unseen.]</p>

<p>The most destructive, perhaps, of the creatures usually
called grubs are the larvæ of the may-bug or cockchafer
(<i>Melolontha vulgaris</i>), but too well known, particularly in the
southern and midland districts of England, as well as in
Ireland, where the grub is called the Connaught worm;<a name="FNanchor_CJ" id="FNanchor_CJ"></a><a href="#Footnote_CJ" class="fnanchor">[CJ]</a>
but fortunately not abundant in the north. We only once
met with the cockchafer in Scotland, at Sorn, in Ayrshire.
(J. R.) Even in the perfect state, this insect is not a little
destructive to the leaves of both forest and fruit trees. In
1823, we remember to have observed almost all the trees
about Dulwich and Camberwell defoliated by them; and
Salisbury says, the leaves of the oaks in Richmond Park
were so eaten by them, that scarcely an entire leaf was left.
But it is in their previous larva state that they are most
destructive, as we shall see by tracing their history.</p>

<p>The mother cockchafer, when about to lay her eggs, digs
into the earth of a meadow or corn-field to the depth of a
span, and deposits them in a cluster at the bottom of the
excavation. Rösel, in order to watch the proceedings, put
some females into glasses half-filled with earth, covered
with a tuft of grass and a piece of thin muslin. In a fortnight,
he found some hundreds of eggs deposited, of an oval
shape and a pale-yellow colour. Placing the glass in a
cellar, the eggs were hatched towards autumn, and the grubs
increased remarkably in size. In the following May they
fed so voraciously that they required a fresh turf every second
day; and even this proving too scanty provender, he sowed
in several garden pots a crop of peas, lentils, and salad, and
when the plants came up he put a pair of grubs in each pot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
and in this manner he fed them through the second and
third years. During this period, they cast their skins three
or four times, going for this purpose deeper into the earth,
and burrowing out a hole where they might effect their
change undisturbed; and they do the same in winter, during
which they become torpid and do not eat.</p>

<p>When the grub changes into a pupa, in the third autumn
after it is hatched, it digs a similar burrow about a yard
deep; and when kept in a pot, and prevented from going
deep enough, it shows great uneasiness and often dies. The
perfect beetle comes forth from the pupa in January or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
February; but it is then as soft as it was whilst still a grub,
and does not acquire its hardness and colour for ten or twelve
days, nor does it venture above ground before May, in the
fourth year from the time of its hatching. At this time, the
beetles may be observed issuing from their holes in the
evening, and dashing themselves about in the air as if blind.</p>

<p>During the three summers then of their existence in the
grub state, these insects do immense injury, burrowing
between the turf and the soil, and devouring the roots of
grass and other plants; so that the turf may easily be rolled
off, as if cut by a turfing spade, while the soil underneath for
an inch or more is turned into soft mould like the bed of a
garden. Mr. Anderson, of Norwich, mentions having seen
a whole field of fine flourishing grass so undermined by these
grubs, that in a few weeks it became as dry, brittle, and
withered as hay.<a name="FNanchor_CK" id="FNanchor_CK"></a><a href="#Footnote_CK" class="fnanchor">[CK]</a> Bingley also tells us that &ldquo;about sixty
years ago, a farm near Norwich was so infested with cockchafers,
that the farmer and his servants affirmed they gathered
eighty bushels of them; and the grubs had done so much
injury, that the court of the city, in compassion to the poor
fellow&rsquo;s misfortune, allowed him twenty-five pounds.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_CL" id="FNanchor_CL"></a><a href="#Footnote_CL" class="fnanchor">[CL]</a> In
the year 1785, a farmer, near Blois, in France, employed a
number of children and poor persons to destroy the cockchafers
at the rate of two liards a hundred, and in a few
days they collected fourteen thousand.<a name="FNanchor_CM" id="FNanchor_CM"></a><a href="#Footnote_CM" class="fnanchor">[CM]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; says Salisbury, &ldquo;seeing in a nursery near
Bagshot, several acres of young forest trees, particularly
larch, the roots of which were completely destroyed by it, so
much so that not a single tree was left alive.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_CN" id="FNanchor_CN"></a><a href="#Footnote_CN" class="fnanchor">[CN]</a> We are
doubtful, however, whether this was the grub of the cockchafer,
and think it more likely to have been that of the
green rose-beetle (<i>Cetonia aurata</i>), which feeds on the roots of
trees.</p>

<p class="caption2">ARCHITECTURE OF ANTS.&mdash;MASON-ANTS.</p>


<p>All the species of ants are social. There are none solitary,
as is the case with bees and wasps. They are all more
or less skilful in architecture, some employing masonry, and
others being carpenters, wood-carvers, and miners. They
consequently afford much that is interesting to naturalists
who observe their operations. The genuine history of ants
has only been recently investigated, first by Gould in 1747,
and subsequently by Linnæus, De Geer, Huber, and Latreille.
Previous to that time their real industry and their imagined
foresight were held up as moral lessons, without any great
accuracy of observation; and it is probable that, even now,
the mixture of truth and error in Addison&rsquo;s delightful papers
in the Guardian (Nos. 156, 157) may be more generally
attractive than the minute relation of careful naturalists.
Gould disproved, most satisfactorily, the ancient fable of ants
storing up corn for winter provision, no species of ants ever
eating grain, or feeding in the winter upon anything. It is
to Huber the younger, however, that we are chiefly indebted
for our knowledge of the habits and economy of ants; and to
Latreille for a closer distinction of the species. Some of the
more interesting species, whose singular economy is described
by the younger Huber, have not been hitherto found in this
country. We shall, however, discover matter of very considerable
interest in those which are indigenous; and as our
principal object is to excite inquiry and observation with
regard to those insects which may be easily watched in our
own gardens and fields, we shall chiefly confine ourselves to
the ants of these islands. We shall begin with the labours
of those native ants which may be called earth-masons, from
their digging in the ground, and forming structures with
pellets of moistened loam, clay, or sand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Mason-Ants.</p>

<p>We have used in the preceding pages the terms <i>mason-bees</i>
and <i>mason-wasps</i>, for insects which build their nests of earthy
materials. On the same principle, we have followed the
ingenious M. Huber the younger, in employing the term
mason-ants for those whose nests on the exterior appear to be
hillocks of earth, without the admixture of other materials,
whilst in the interior they present a series of labyrinths,
lodges, vaults, and galleries constructed with considerable
skill. Of these mason-ants, as of the mason-wasps and bees
already described, there are several species, differing from
one another in their skill in the art of architecture.</p>

<p>One of the most common of the ant-masons is the turf-ant
(<i>Formica cæspitum</i>, <span class="smcap">Latr.</span>), which is very small and of a
blackish-brown colour. Its architecture is not upon quite
so extensive a scale as some of the others; but, though slight,
it is very ingenious. Sometimes they make choice of the
shelter of a flat stone or other covering, beneath which they
hollow out chambers and communicating galleries; at other
times they are contented with the open ground; but most
commonly they select a tuft of grass or other herbage, the
stems of which serve for columns to their earthen walls.</p>

<p>We had a small colony of these ants accidentally established
in a flower-pot, in which we were rearing some young plants
of the tiger-lily (<i>Lilium tigrinum</i>), the stems of which being
stronger than the grass where they usually build, enabled
them to rear their edifice higher, and also to make it more
secure, than they otherwise might. It was wholly formed
of small grains of moist earth, piled up between the stems of
the lily without any apparent cement; indeed it has been
ascertained by Huber, as we shall afterwards see, that they
use no cement beside water. This is not always to be procured,
as they depend altogether on rains and dew; but they
possess the art of joining grains of dry sand so as to support
one another, on some similar principle, no doubt, to that of
the arch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>The nest which our turf-ants constructed in the flower-pot
was externally of an imperfect square form, in consequence
of its situation; for they usually prefer a circular plan.
The principal chambers were placed under the arches, and,
when inspected, contained a pile of cocoons, and pupæ.
Beneath those upper chambers there were others dug out
deeper down, in which were also a numerous collection of
eggs and cocoons in various stages of advancement. (J. R.)</p>

<p>Mr. Knapp describes a still more curious structure of
another species of ant common in this country:&mdash;&ldquo;One
year,&rdquo; says he, "on the third of March, my labourer being
employed in cutting up ant-hills, or tumps as we call them,
exposed to view multitudes of the yellow species (<i>Formica
flava</i>) in their winter&rsquo;s retirement. They were collected in
numbers in little cells and compartments, communicating
with others by means of narrow passages. In many of the
cells they had deposited their larvæ, which they were surrounding
and attending, but not brooding over or covering. Being
disturbed by our rude operations, they removed them from
our sight to more hidden compartments. The larvæ were
small. Some of these ant-hills contained multitudes of the
young of the wood-louse (<i>Oniscus armadillo</i>), inhabiting with
perfect familiarity the same compartments as the ants, crawling
about with great activity with them, and perfectly
domesticated with each other. They were small and white;
but the constant vibration of their antennæ, and the alacrity
of their motions, manifested a healthy vigour. The ants
were in a torpid state; but on being removed into a temperate
room, they assumed much of their summer&rsquo;s animation.
How these creatures are supported during the winter
season it is difficult to comprehend; as in no one instance
could we perceive any store or provision made for the supply
of their wants. The minute size of the larvæ manifested
that they had been recently deposited; and consequently that
their parents had not remained during winter in a dormant
state, and thus free from the calls of hunger. The preceding
month of February, and part of January, had been remarkably
severe; the frost had penetrated deep into the earth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
and long held it frozen; the ants were in many cases not
more than four inches beneath the surface, and must have
been enclosed in a mass of frozen soil for a long period; yet
they, their young, and the onisci, were perfectly uninjured
by it: affording another proof of the fallacy of the commonly
received opinion, that cold is <i>universally</i> destructive to insect
life."<a name="FNanchor_CO" id="FNanchor_CO"></a><a href="#Footnote_CO" class="fnanchor">[CO]</a></p>

<p>The earth employed by mason-ants is usually moist clay,
either dug from the interior parts of their city or moistened
by rain. The mining-ants and the ash-coloured (<i>Formica
fusca</i>) employ earth which is probably not selected with so
much care, for it forms a much coarser mortar than what we
see used in the structure of the yellow ants (<i>F. flava</i>) and
the brown ants (<i>F. brunnea</i>). We have never observed them
bringing their building materials of this kind from a distance,
like the mason-bees and like the wood or hill ant (<i>F. rufa</i>);
but they take care, before they fix upon a locality, that it
shall produce them all that they require. We are indebted
to Huber the younger for the most complete account which
has hitherto been given of these operations, of which details
we shall make free use.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To form,&rdquo; says this shrewd observer, "a correct judgment
of the interior arrangement or distribution of an ant-hill, it
is necessary to select such as have not been accidentally
spoiled, or whose form has not been too much altered by
local circumstances; a slight attention will then suffice to
show that the habitations of the different species are not all
constructed after the same system. Thus, the hillock raised
by the ash-coloured ants will always present thick walls,
fabricated with coarse earth, well-marked stories, and large
chambers, with vaulted ceilings, resting upon a solid base.
We never observe roads, or galleries, properly so called, but
large passages, of an oval form, and all around considerable
cavities and extensive embankments of earth. We further
notice, that the little architects observe a certain proportion
between the large arched ceilings and the pillars that are to
support them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>"The brown ant (<i>Formica brunnea</i>), one of the smallest
of the ants, is particularly remarkable for the extreme finish
of its work. Its body is of a reddish shining brown, its head
a little deeper, and the antennæ and feet a little lighter in
colour. The abdomen is of an obscure brown, the scale
narrow, of a square form, and slightly scolloped. The body
is one line and two-fifths in length.<a name="FNanchor_CP" id="FNanchor_CP"></a><a href="#Footnote_CP" class="fnanchor">[CP]</a></p>

<p>"This ant, one of the most industrious of its tribe, forms
its nest of stories four or five lines in height. The partitions
are not more than half a line in thickness; and the substance
of which they are composed is so finely grained, that the
inner walls present one smooth unbroken surface. These
stories are not horizontal; they follow the slope of the ant-hill,
and lie one upon another to the ground-floor, which
communicates with the subterranean lodges. They are not
always, however, arranged with the same regularity, for these
ants do not follow an invariable plan; it appears, on the
contrary, that nature has allowed them a certain latitude in
this respect, and that they can, according to circumstances,
modify them to their wish; but however fantastical their
habitations may appear, we always observe they have been
formed by concentrical stories. On examining each story
separately, we observe a number of cavities or halls, lodges of
narrower dimensions, and long galleries, which serve for
general communication. The arched ceilings covering the
most spacious places are supported either by little columns,
slender walls, or by regular buttresses. We also notice
chambers, that have but one entrance, communicating with
the lower story, and large open spaces, serving as a kind of
cross-road (<i>carrefour</i>), in which all the streets terminate.</p>

<p>"Such is the manner in which the habitations of these
ants are constructed. Upon opening them, we commonly
find the apartments, as well as the large open spaces, filled
with adult ants; and always observed their pupæ collected
in the apartments more or less near the surface. This, however,
seems regulated by the hour of the day, and the temperature:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
for in this respect these ants are endowed with great
sensibility, and know the degree of heat best adapted for
their young. The ant-hill contains, sometimes, more than
twenty stories in its upper portion, and at least as many
under the surface of the ground. By this arrangement the
ants are enabled, with the greatest facility, to regulate the
heat. When a too-burning sun overheats their upper apartments,
they withdraw their little ones to the bottom of the
ant-hill. The ground-floor becoming, in its turn, uninhabitable
during the rainy season, the ants of this species transport
what most interests them to the higher stories; and it
is there we find them more usually assembled, with their
eggs and pupæ, when the subterranean apartments are
submerged."<a name="FNanchor_CQ" id="FNanchor_CQ"></a><a href="#Footnote_CQ" class="fnanchor">[CQ]</a></p>

<p>Ants have a great dislike to water, when it exceeds that
of a light shower to moisten their building materials. One
species, mentioned by Azara as indigenous to South America,
instinctively builds a nest from three to six feet high,<a name="FNanchor_CR" id="FNanchor_CR"></a><a href="#Footnote_CR" class="fnanchor">[CR]</a> to
provide against the inundations during the rainy season.
Even this, however, does not always save them from submersion;
and, when that occurs, they are compelled, in order
to prevent themselves from being swept away, to form a
group somewhat similar to the curtain of the wax-workers of
hive-bees (see <a href="#Page_133">p. 133</a>). The ants constituting the basis of
this group lay hold of some shrub for security, while their
companions hold on by them; and thus the whole colony,
forming an animated raft, floats on the surface of the water
till the inundation (which seldom continues longer than a
day or two) subsides. We confess, however, that we are
somewhat sceptical respecting this story, notwithstanding
the very high character of the Spanish naturalist.</p>

<p>It is usual with architectural insects to employ some
animal secretion, by way of mortar or size, to temper the
materials with which they work; but the whole economy of
ants is so different, that it would be wrong to infer from
analogy a similarity in this respect, though the exquisite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
polish and extreme delicacy of finish in their structures lead,
naturally, to such a conclusion. M. P. Huber, in order to
resolve this question, at first thought of subjecting the
materials of the walls to chemical analysis, but wisely (as we
think) abandoned it for the surer method of observation.
The details which he has given, as the result of his researches,
are exceedingly curious and instructive. He began
by observing an ant-hill till he could perceive some change
in its form.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The inhabitants,&rdquo; says he, "of that which I selected, kept
within during the day, or only went out by subterranean
galleries which opened at some feet distance in the meadow.
There were, however, two or three small openings on the
surface of the nest; but I saw none of the labourers pass out
this way, on account of their being too much exposed to the
sun, which these insects greatly dread. This ant-hill,
which had a round form, rose in the grass, at the border of
a path, and had sustained no injury. I soon perceived that
the freshness of the air and the dew invited the ants to walk
over the surface of their nest; they began making new
apertures; several ants might be seen arriving at the same
time, thrusting their heads from the entrances, moving about
their antennæ, and at length adventuring forth to visit the
environs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This brought to my recollection a singular opinion of
the ancients. They believed that ants were occupied in their
architectural labours during the night, when the moon was
at its full.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_CS" id="FNanchor_CS"></a><a href="#Footnote_CS" class="fnanchor">[CS]</a></p>

<p>M. Latreille discovered a species of ants which were, so
far as he could ascertain, completely blind,<a name="FNanchor_CT" id="FNanchor_CT"></a><a href="#Footnote_CT" class="fnanchor">[CT]</a> and of course it
would be immaterial to them whether they worked by night
or during the day. All observers indeed agree that ants
labour in the night, and a French naturalist is therefore of
opinion that they never sleep&mdash;a circumstance which is well
ascertained with respect to other animals, such as the shark,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
which will track a ship in full sail for weeks together.<a name="FNanchor_CU" id="FNanchor_CU"></a><a href="#Footnote_CU" class="fnanchor">[CU]</a> The
ingenious historian of English ants, Gould, says they never
intermit their labours by night or by day, except when compelled
by excessive rains. It is probable the ancients were
mistaken in asserting that they only work when the moon
shines;<a name="FNanchor_CV" id="FNanchor_CV"></a><a href="#Footnote_CV" class="fnanchor">[CV]</a> for, like bees, they seem to find no difficulty in
building in the dark, their subterranean apartments being
as well finished as the upper stories of their buildings. But
to proceed with the narrative of M. P. Huber.</p>

<p>"Having thus noticed the movements of these insects
during the night, I found they were almost always abroad
and engaged about the dome of their habitation after sunset.
This was directly the reverse of what I had observed in the
conduct of the wood-ants (<i>F. rufa</i>), who only go out during
the day, and close their doors in the evening. The contrast
was still more remarkable than I had previously supposed;
for, upon visiting the brown ants some days after, during a
gentle rain, I saw all their architectural talents in full play.</p>

<p>"As soon as the rain commenced, they left in great
numbers their subterranean residence, re-entered it almost
immediately, and then returned, bearing between their teeth
pellets of earth, which they deposited on the roof of their
nest. I could not at first conceive what this was meant for,
but at length I saw little walls start up on all sides with
spaces left between them. In several places, columns,
ranged at regular distances, announced halls, lodges, and
passages which the ants proposed establishing; in a word,
it was the rough beginning of a new story.</p>

<p>"I watched with a considerable degree of interest the
most trifling movements of my masons, and found they did
not work after the manner of wasps and humble-bees, when
occupied in constructing a covering to their nest. The
latter sit, as it were, astride on the border or margin of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
covering, and take it between their teeth to model and attenuate
it according to their wish. The wax of which it is
composed, and the paper which the wasp employs, moistened
by some kind of glue, are admirably adapted for this purpose,
but the earth of which the ants make use, from its often
possessing little tenacity, must be worked up after some
other manner.</p>

<p>"Each ant, then, carried between its teeth the pellet of
earth it had formed by scraping with the end of its mandibles
the bottom of its abode, a circumstance which I have frequently
witnessed in open day. This little mass of earth,
being composed of particles but just united, could be readily
kneaded and moulded as the ants wished; thus when they
had applied it to the spot where they had to rest, they divided
and pressed against it with their teeth, so as to fill up
the little inequalities of their wall. The antennæ followed
all their movements, passing over each particle of earth as
soon as it was placed in its proper position. The whole was
then rendered more compact by pressing it lightly with the
fore-feet. This work went on remarkably fast. After
having traced out the plan of their masonry, in laying here
and there foundations for the pillars and partitions they
were about to erect, they raised them gradually higher, by
adding fresh materials. It often happened that two little
walls, which were to form a gallery, were raised opposite,
and at a slight distance from each other. When they had
attained the height of four or five lines, the ants busied
themselves in covering in the space left between them by a
vaulted ceiling.</p>

<p>"As if they judged all their partitions of sufficient elevation,
they then quitted their labours in the upper part of
the building; they affixed to the interior and upper part of
each wall fragments of moistened earth, in an almost horizontal
direction, and in such a way as to form a ledge,
which, by extension, would be made to join that coming
from the opposite wall. These ledges were about half a
line in thickness; and the breadth of the galleries was, for
the most part, about a quarter of an inch. On one side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
several vertical partitions were seen to form the scaffolding
of a lodge, which communicated with several corridors
by apertures formed in the masonry; on another, a regularly-formed
hall was constructed, the vaulted ceiling of
which was sustained by numerous pillars; further off, again,
might be recognised the rudiments of one of those cross
roads of which I have before spoken, and in which several
avenues terminate. These parts of the ant-hill were the
most spacious; the ants, however, did not appear embarrassed
in constructing the ceiling to cover them in, although they
were often more than two inches in breadth.</p>

<p>"In the upper part of the angles formed by the different
walls, they laid the first foundations of this ceiling, and from
the top of each pillar, as from so many centres, a layer of
earth, horizontal and slightly convex, was carried forward to
meet the several portions coming from different points of the
large public thoroughfare.</p>

<p>"I sometimes, however, laboured under an apprehension
that the building could not possibly resist its own weight,
and that such extensive ceilings, sustained only by a few
pillars, would fall into ruin from the rain which continually
dropped upon them; but I was quickly convinced of their
stability, from observing that the earth brought by these
insects adhered at all points, on the slightest contact; and
that the rain, so far from lessening the cohesion of its particles,
appeared even to increase it. Thus, instead of injuring
the building, it even contributed to render it still more
secure.</p>

<p>"These particles of moistened earth, which are only held
together by juxtaposition, require a fall of rain to cement
them more closely, and thus varnish over, as it were, those
places where the walls and galleries remain uncovered. All
inequalities in the masonry then disappear. The upper part
of these stories, formed of several pieces brought together,
presents but one single layer of compact earth. They require
for their complete consolidation nothing but the heat of
the sun. It sometimes, however, happens that a violent rain
will destroy the apartments, especially should they be but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
slightly arched; but under these circumstances the ants reconstruct
them with wonderful patience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These different labours were carried on at the same
time, and were so closely followed up in the different
quarters, that the ant-hill received an additional story in
the course of seven or eight hours. All the vaulted ceilings
being formed upon a regular plan, and at equal distances
from one wall to the other, constituted, when finished, but
one single roof. Scarcely had the ants finished one story
than they began to construct another; but they had not time
to finish it&mdash;the rain ceasing before the ceiling was fully
completed. They still, however, continued their work for a
few hours, taking advantage of the humidity of the earth;
but a keen north wind soon sprung up, and hastily dried the
collected fragments, which, no longer possessing the same
adherence, readily fell into powder. The ants, finding their
efforts ineffectual, were at length discouraged, and abandoned
their employment; but what was my astonishment when I
saw them destroy all the apartments that were yet uncovered,
scattering here and there over the last story the materials of
which they had been composed! These facts incontestably
prove that they employ neither gum, nor any kind of cement,
to bind together the several substances of their nest; but
in place of this avail themselves of the rain, to work or
knead the earth, leaving the sun and wind to dry and consolidate
it.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_CW" id="FNanchor_CW"></a><a href="#Footnote_CW" class="fnanchor">[CW]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Johnson of Bristol observed very similar proceedings
in the case of a colony of red ants (<i>Myrmica rubra?</i>), the roof
of whose nest was formed by a flat stone. During dry weather,
a portion of the side walls fell in; but the rubbish was
quickly removed, though no repairs were attempted till a
shower of rain enabled them to work. As soon as this
occurred, they worked with extraordinary rapidity, and in a
short time the whole of the fallen parts were rebuilt, and
rendered as smooth as if polished with a trowel.</p>

<p>When a gardener wishes to water a plot of ground where
he has sown seeds that require nice management, he dips a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
strong brush into water, and passes his hand backwards and
forwards over the hairs for the purpose of producing a fine
artificial shower. Huber successfully adopted the same
method to excite his ants to recommence their labours, which
had been interrupted for want of moisture. But sometimes,
when they deem it unadvisable to wait for rain, they dig
down (as we remarked to be the practice of the mason-bees)
till they arrive at earth sufficiently moist for their purpose.
They do not, however, like these bees, merely dig for materials;
for they use the excavations for apartments, as well as
what they construct with the materials thence derived. They
appear, in short, to be no less skilful in mining than in
building.</p>

<p>Such is the general outline of the operations of this
singular species; but we are still more interested with the
history which M. P. Huber has given of the labours of an
individual ant. &ldquo;One rainy day,&rdquo; he says, "I observed a
labourer of the dark ash-coloured species (<i>Formica fusca</i>)
digging the ground near the aperture which gave entrance to
the ant-hill. It placed in a heap the several fragments it
had scraped up, and formed them into small pellets, which it
deposited here and there upon the nest. It returned constantly
to the same place, and appeared to have a particular
design, for it laboured with ardour and perseverance. I
remarked a slight furrow, excavated in the ground in a
straight line, representing the plan of a path or gallery. The
labourer (the whole of whose movements fell under my immediate
observation) gave it greater depth and breadth, and
cleared out its borders; and I saw, at length&mdash;in which I
could not be deceived&mdash;that it had the intention of establishing
an avenue which was to lead from one of the stories to
the underground chambers. This path, which was about
two or three inches in length, and formed by a single ant,
was opened above, and bordered on each side by a buttress
of earth. Its concavity, in the form of a pipe (<i>gouttière</i>), was
of the most perfect regularity: for the architect had not left
an atom too much. The work of this ant was so well followed
and understood, that I could almost to a certainty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
guess its next proceeding, and the very fragment it was
about to remove. At the side of the opening where this
path terminated was a second opening, to which it was
necessary to arrive by some road. The same ant began and
finished this undertaking without assistance. It furrowed
out and opened another path, parallel to the first, leaving
between each a little wall of three or four lines in height."</p>

<p>Like the hive-bees, ants do not seem to work in concert,
but each individual separately. There is, consequently, an
occasional want of coincidence in the walls and arches; but
this does not much embarrass them, for a worker, on discovering
an error of this kind, seems to know how to rectify
it, as appears from the following observations:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wall,&rdquo; says M. Huber, "had been erected, with the
view of sustaining a vaulted ceiling, still incomplete, that
had been projected towards the wall of the opposite chamber.
The workman who began constructing it had given it too
little elevation to meet the opposite partition, upon which
it was to rest. Had it been continued on the original plan,
it must infallibly have met the wall at about one-half of its
height; and this it was necessary to avoid. This state of
things very forcibly claimed my attention; when one of the
ants arriving at the place, and visiting the works, appeared
to be struck by the difficulty which presented itself; but this
it as soon obviated, by taking down the ceiling, and raising the
wall upon which it reposed. It then, in my presence, constructed
a new ceiling with the fragments of the former one.</p>

<p>"When the ants commence any undertaking, one would
suppose that they worked after some preconceived idea,
which, indeed, would seem verified by the execution. Thus,
should any ant discover upon the nest two stalks of plants
which lie crossways, a disposition favourable to the construction
of a lodge, or some little beams that may be useful in
forming its angles and sides, it examines the several parts
with attention; then distributes, with much sagacity and
address, parcels of earth in the spaces, and along the stems,
taking from every quarter materials adapted to its object,
sometimes not caring to destroy the work that others had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
commenced; so much are its motions regulated by the idea
it has conceived, and upon which it acts, with little attention
to all else around it. It goes and returns, until the plan is
sufficiently understood by its companions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In another part of the same ant-hill,&rdquo; continues M.
Huber, &ldquo;several fragments of straw seemed expressly placed
to form the roof of a large house: a workman took advantage
of this disposition. These fragments lying horizontally, at
half-an-inch distance from the ground, formed, in crossing
each other, an oblong parallelogram. The industrious insect
commenced by placing earth in the several angles of this
framework, and all along the little beams of which it was
composed. The same workman afterwards placed several
rows of the same materials against each other, when the roof
became very distinct. On perceiving the possibility of
profiting by another plant to support a vertical wall, it
began laying the foundations of it; other ants having by
this time arrived, finished in common what this had commenced.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_CX" id="FNanchor_CX"></a><a href="#Footnote_CX" class="fnanchor">[CX]</a></p>

<p>M. Huber made most of his observations upon the processes
followed by ants in glazed artificial hives or formicaries.
The preceding figure represents a view of one of his
formicaries of mason-ants.</p>

<p>We have ourselves followed up his observations, both on
natural ant-hills and in artificial formicaries. On digging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
cautiously into a natural ant-hill, established upon the edge
of a garden-walk, we were enabled to obtain a pretty complete
view of the interior structure. There were two stories,
composed of large chambers, irregularly oval, communicating
with each other by arched galleries, the walls of all
which were as smooth and well-polished as if they had been
passed over by a plasterer&rsquo;s trowel. The floors of the
chambers, we remarked, were by no means either horizontal
or level, but all more or less sloped, and exhibiting in each
chamber at least two slight depressions of an irregular
shape. We left the under story of this nest untouched, with
the notion that the ants might repair the upper galleries, of
which we had made a vertical section; but instead of doing
so they migrated during the day to a large crack formed by
the dryness of the weather, about a yard from their old nest.
(J. R.)</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 278px;">
<img src="images/292.png" width="278" height="161" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We put a number of yellow ants (<i>Formica flava</i>), with
their eggs and cocoons, into a small glass frame, more than
half full of moist sand taken from their native hill, and
placed in a sloping position, in order to see whether they
would bring the nearly vertical, and therefore insecure, portion
to a level by masonry. We were delighted to perceive
that they immediately resolved upon performing the task
which had been assigned them, though they did not proceed
very methodically in their manner of building; for instead
of beginning at the bottom and building upwards, many of
them went on to add to the top of the outer surface, which
increased rather than diminished the insecurity of the whole.
Withal, however, they seemed to know how far to go, for no
portion of the newly-built wall fell; and in two days they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
had not only reared a pyramidal mound to prop the rest, but
had constructed several galleries and chambers for lodging
the cocoons, which we had scattered at random amongst the
sand. The new portion of this building is represented in the
figure as supporting the upper and insecure parts of the
nest.</p>

</div>

<p>We are sorry to record that our ingenious little masons
were found upon the third day strewed about the outside of
the building dead or dying, either from over-fatigue or perhaps
from surfeit, as we had supplied them with as much
honey as they could devour. A small colony of turf-ants
have at this moment (July 28th, 1829) taken possession of
the premises of their own accord. (J. R.)</p>

<p class="caption2">STRUCTURES OF THE WOOD-ANT OR PISMIRE, AND OF CARPENTER-ANTS.</p>


<p>The largest of our British ants is that called the Hill-ant
by Gould, the Fallow-ant by the English translator of
Huber, and popularly the Pismire; but which we think may
be more appropriately named the Wood-ant (<i>Formica rufa</i>,
<span class="smcap">Latr.</span>), from its invariable habit of living in or near woods
and forests. This insect may be readily distinguished from
other ants by the dusky black colour of its head and hinder
parts, and the rusty brown of its middle. The structures
reared by this species are often of considerable magnitude,
and bear no small resemblance to a rook&rsquo;s nest thrown upon
the ground bottom upwards. They occur in abundance in the
woods near London, and in many other parts of the country:
in Oak of Honour Wood alone, we are acquainted with the
localities of at least two dozen,&mdash;some in the interior, and
others on the hedge-banks on the outskirts of the wood.
(J. R.)</p>

<p>The exterior of the nest is composed of almost every transportable
material which the colonists can find in their
vicinity; but the greater portion consists of the stems of
withered grass and short twigs of trees, piled up in apparent
confusion, but with sufficient regularity to render the whole
smooth, conical, and sloping towards the base, for the purpose,
we may infer, of carrying off rain-water. When within
reach of a corn-field, they often also pick up grains of wheat,
barley, or oats, and carry them to the nest as building
materials, and not for food, as was believed by the ancients.
There are wonders enough observable in the economy of
ants, without having recourse to fancy&mdash;wonders which made
Aristotle extol the sagacity of bloodless animals, and Cicero
ascribe to them not only sensation, but mind, reason, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
memory.<a name="FNanchor_CY" id="FNanchor_CY"></a><a href="#Footnote_CY" class="fnanchor">[CY]</a> Ælian, however, describes, as if he had actually
witnessed it, the ants ascending a stalk of growing corn, and
throwing down &ldquo;the ears which they bit off to their companions
below.&rdquo; Aldrovand assures us that he had seen their
granaries; and others pretend that they shrewdly bite off the
ends of the grain to prevent it from germinating.<a name="FNanchor_CZ" id="FNanchor_CZ"></a><a href="#Footnote_CZ" class="fnanchor">[CZ]</a> These
are fables which accurate observation has satisfactorily contradicted.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Nest of Wood-Ant.</span>
</div>

<p>But these errors, as it frequently happens, have contributed
to a more perfect knowledge of the insects than we might
otherwise have obtained; for it was the wish to prove or disprove
the circumstance of their storing up and feeding upon
grain which led Gould to make his observations on English
ants; as the notion of insects being produced <i>from</i> putrid
carcases had before led Redi to his ingenious experiments on
their generation. Yet, although it is more than eighty years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
since Gould&rsquo;s book was published, we find the error still repeated
in very respectable publications.<a name="FNanchor_DA" id="FNanchor_DA"></a><a href="#Footnote_DA" class="fnanchor">[DA]</a></p>

<p>The coping which we above described as forming the
exterior of the wood-ant&rsquo;s nest, is only a small portion of the
structure, which consists of a great number of interior chambers
and galleries, with funnel-shaped avenues leading to
them. The coping, indeed, is one of the most essential
parts, and we cannot follow a more delightful guide than the
younger Huber in detailing its formation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The labourers,&rdquo; he says, "of which the colony is composed,
not only work continually on the outside of their nest,
but, differing very essentially from other species, who willingly
remain in the interior, sheltered from the sun, they
prefer living in the open air, and do not hesitate to carry on,
even in our presence, the greater part of their operations.</p>

<p>"To have an idea how the straw or stubble-roof is formed,
let us take a view of the ant-hill at its origin, when it is
simply a cavity in the earth. Some of its future inhabitants
are seen wandering about in search of materials fit for the
exterior work, with which, though rather irregularly, they
cover up the entrance; whilst others are employed in mixing
the earth, thrown up in hollowing the interior, with fragments
of wood and leaves, which are every moment brought
in by their fellow-assistants; and this gives a certain consistence
to the edifice, which increases in size daily. Our little
architects leave here and there cavities, where they intend
constructing the galleries which are to lead to the exterior,
and as they remove in the morning the barriers placed at the
entrance of their nest the preceding evening, the passages are
kept open during the whole time of its construction. We
soon observed the roof to become convex; but we should be
greatly deceived did we consider it solid. This roof is destined
to include many apartments or stories. Having observed
the motions of these little builders through a pane of glass,
adjusted against one of their habitations, I am thence enabled
to speak with some degree of certainty upon the manner in
which they are constructed. I ascertained that it is by excavating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
or mining the under portion of their edifice that they
form their spacious halls&mdash;low, indeed, and of heavy construction,
yet sufficiently convenient for the use to which
they are appropriated, that of receiving, at certain hours of
the day, the larvæ and pupæ.</p>

<p>"These halls have a free communication by galleries, made
in the same manner. If the materials of which the ant-hill
is composed were only interlaced, they would fall into a confused
heap every time the ants attempted to bring them into
regular order. This, however, is obviated by their tempering
the earth with rain-water, which, afterwards hardened in the
sun, so completely and effectually binds together the several
substances, as to permit the removal of certain fragments
from the ant-hill without any injury to the rest; it, moreover,
strongly opposes the introduction of the rain. I never found,
even after long and violent rains, the interior of the nest
wetted to more than a quarter of an inch from the surface,
provided it had not been previously out of repair, or deserted
by its inhabitants.</p>

<p>"The ants are extremely well sheltered in their chambers,
the largest of which is placed nearly in the centre of the
building; it is much loftier than the rest, and traversed only
by the beams that support the ceiling; it is in this spot that
all the galleries terminate, and this forms, for the most part,
their usual residence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to the underground portion, it can only be seen when
the ant-hill is placed against a declivity; all the interior
may be then readily brought in view, by simply raising up
the straw roof. The subterranean residence consists of a
range of apartments, excavated in the earth, taking an horizontal
direction.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_DB" id="FNanchor_DB"></a><a href="#Footnote_DB" class="fnanchor">[DB]</a></p>

<p>[It seems rather surprising that the wood-ants should be
able, with such materials as they employ, to make a dome-shaped
structure, which shall be furnished with cells and
galleries, and yet shall endure rain and wind, without being
penetrated by the one or blown away by the other. If the
hill be closely examined, the little sticks of which it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
composed will be seen to have a definite, though not very
regular arrangement; and it is a noteworthy circumstance
that the longest are preserved for the galleries, being laid
across each other in a very ingenious manner, so as to prevent
the material from falling and filling up the galleries. This
structure was shown very clearly in a huge ant-hill in Bagshot
Park. We introduced a sheet of plate glass into the nest, so
as to divide it perpendicularly into two halves, and having
given the insects six weeks to repair damages, we removed
one half of the hill, so that the whole interior of the other half
could be seen through the glass. The whole economy of the
nest was thus made clear, and the artificial arrangement of
the materials showed itself very plainly on the roofs of the
cells and galleries.]</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 312px;">
<img src="images/298.png" width="312" height="369" alt="" />
</div>

<p>M. P. Huber, in order to observe the operations of the
wood-ant with more attention, transferred colonies of them
to his artificial formicaries, plunging the feet of the stand into
water to prevent their escape till they were reconciled to their
abode, and had made some progress in repairing it.</p>

<p>[Under the glass shade on the top of the formicary may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
be seen the mound which the wood-ants have raised, according
to their custom, and below, through the glass front, the
reader may see the various passages and cells which communicate
with the hill above. As the ants require that the
lower part of their dwelling should be in darkness, a
stout wooden door can be shut over the glass to exclude the
light.]</p>

<p>There is this remarkable difference in the nest of the
wood-ants, that they do not construct a long covert way as if
for concealment, as the yellow and the brown ants do. The
wood-ants are not, like them, afraid of being surprised by
enemies, at least during the day, when the whole colony is
either foraging in the vicinity or employed on the exterior.
But the proceedings of the wood-ants at night are well
worthy of notice; and when M. Huber began to study their
economy, he directed his entire attention to their night
proceedings. &ldquo;I remarked,&rdquo; says he, "that their habitations
changed in appearance hourly, and that the diameter of those
spacious avenues, where so many ants could freely pass each
other during the day, was, as night approached, gradually
lessened. The aperture, at length, totally disappeared, the
dome was closed on all sides, and the ants retired to the
bottom of their nest.</p>

<p>"In further noticing the apertures of these ant-hills, I
fully ascertained the nature of the labour of its inhabitants,
of which I could not before even guess the purport; for the
surface of the nest presented such a constant scene of agitation,
and so many insects were occupied in carrying materials
in every direction, that the movement offered no other image
than that of confusion.</p>

<p>"I saw then clearly that they were engaged in stopping
up passages; and for this purpose they at first brought
forward little pieces of wood, which they deposited near the
entrance of those avenues they wished to close; they placed
them in the stubble; they then went to seek other twigs and
fragments of wood, which they disposed above the first, but
in a different direction, and appeared to choose pieces of less
size in proportion as the work advanced. They, at length,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
brought in a number of dried leaves, and other materials of
an enlarged form, with which they covered the roof: an exact
miniature of the art of our builders, when they form the
covering of any building. Nature, indeed, seems everywhere
to have anticipated the inventions of which we boast, and
this is doubtless one of the most simple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our little insects, now in safety in their nest, retire
gradually to the interior before the last passages are closed;
one or two only remain without, or concealed behind the
doors on guard, while the rest either take their repose, or
engage in different occupations in the most perfect security.
I was impatient to know what took place in the morning
upon these ant-hills, and therefore visited them at an early
hour. I found them in the same state in which I had left
them the preceding evening. A few ants were wandering
about on the surface of the nest, some others issued from
time to time from under the margin of their little roofs
formed at the entrance of the galleries; others afterwards
came forth, who began removing the wooden bars that blockaded
the entrance, in which they readily succeeded. This
labour occupied them several hours. The passages were at
length free, and the materials with which they had been
closed scattered here and there over the ant-hill. Every day,
morning and evening, during the fine weather, I was a witness
to similar proceedings. On days of rain the doors of all the
ant-hills remained closed. When the sky was cloudy in
the morning, or rain was indicated, the ants, who seemed
to be aware of it, opened but in part their several avenues,
and immediately closed them when the rain commenced.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_DC" id="FNanchor_DC"></a><a href="#Footnote_DC" class="fnanchor">[DC]</a></p>

<p>The galleries and chambers which are roofed in as thus
described are very similar to those of the mason-ants,
being partly excavated in the earth, and partly built with
the clay thence procured. It is in these they pass the
night, and also the colder months of the winter, when they
become torpid, or nearly so, and of course require not the
winter granaries of corn with which the ancients fabulously
furnished them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Carpenter-Ants.</p>

<p>The ants that work in wood perform much more extensive
operations than any of the other carpenter insects
which we have mentioned. Their only tools, like those of
bees and wasps, are their jaws or mandibles; but though
these may not appear so curiously constructed as the ovipositor
file of the tree-hopper (<i>Cicada</i>), or the rasp and saw of
the saw-flies (<i>Tenthredinidæ</i>), they are no less efficient in the
performance of what is required. Among the carpenter-ants,
the emmet or jet-ant (<i>F. fuliginosa</i>) holds the first rank, and
is easily known by being rather less in size than the wood-ant,
and by its fine shining black colour. It is less common
in Britain than some of the preceding, though its colonies
may occasionally be met with in the trunks of decaying oak
or willow trees in hedges.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The labourers,&rdquo; says Huber, "of this species work
always in the interior of trees, and are desirous of being
screened from observation: thus every hope on our part is
precluded of following them in their several occupations.
I tried every expedient I could devise to surmount this difficulty;
I endeavoured to accustom these ants to live and work
under my inspection, but all my efforts were unsuccessful;
they even abandoned the most considerable portion of their
nest to seek some new asylum, and spurned the honey and
sugar which I offered them for nourishment. I was now, by
necessity, limited to the inspection only of their edifices:
but, by decomposing some of the fragments with care, I hoped
to acquire some knowledge of their organization.</p>

<p>"On one side I found horizontal galleries, hidden in
great part by their walls, which follow the circular direction
of the layers of the wood; and on another, parallel galleries,
separated by extremely thin partitions, having no communication
except by a few oval apertures. Such is the nature
of these works, remarkable for their delicacy and lightness.</p>

<p>"In other fragments I found avenues which opened
laterally, including portions of walls and transverse partitions,
erected here and there within the galleries, so as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
to form separate chambers. When the work is further
advanced, round holes are always observed, encased, as it
were, between two pillars cut out in the same wall. These
holes in course of time become square, and the pillars,
originally arched at both ends, are worked into regular
columns by the chisel of our sculptors. This, then, is the
second specimen of their art. This portion of the edifice will
probably remain in this state.</p>

<p>"But in another quarter are fragments differently wrought,
in which these same partitions, pierced now in every part,
and hewn skilfully, are transformed into colonnades, which
sustain the upper stories, and leave a free communication
throughout the whole extent. It can readily be perceived
how parallel galleries, hollowed out upon the same plan, and
the sides taken down, leaving only from space to space what
is necessary to sustain their ceilings, may form an entire
story; but as each has been pierced separately, the flooring
cannot be very level: this, however, the ants turn to their
advantage, since these furrows are better adapted to retain
the larvæ that may be placed there.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 289px;">
<img src="images/302.png" width="289" height="236" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Portion of a Tree, with Chambers and Galleries chiseled out by Jet-Ants.</span>
</div>

<p>"The stories constructed in the great roots offer greater
irregularity than those in the very body of the tree, arising
either from the hardness and interlacing of the fibres, which
renders the labour more difficult, and obliges the labourers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
to depart from their accustomed manner, or from their not
observing in the extremities of their edifice the same
arrangement as in the centre: whatever it be, horizontal
stories and numerous partitions are still found. If the work
be less regular, it becomes more delicate; for the ants,
profiting by the hardness and solidity of the materials, give
to their building an extreme degree of lightness. I have
seen fragments of from eight to ten inches in length, and of
equal height, formed of wood as thin as paper, containing a
number of apartments, and presenting a most singular
appearance. At the entrance of these apartments, worked
out with so much care, are very considerable openings; but
in place of chambers and extensive galleries, the layers of
the wood are hewn in arcades, allowing the ants a free
passage in every direction. These may be regarded as the
gates or vestibules conducting to the several lodges."<a name="FNanchor_DD" id="FNanchor_DD"></a><a href="#Footnote_DD" class="fnanchor">[DD]</a></p>

<p>It is a singular circumstance in the structures of these
ants, that all the wood which they carve is tinged of a black
colour, as if it were smoked; and M. Huber was not a little
solicitous to discover whence this arose. It certainly does
not add to the beauty of their streets, which look as sombre
as the most smoke-dyed walls in the older lanes of the metropolis.
M. Huber could not satisfy himself whether it was
caused by the exposure of the wood to the atmosphere, by
some emanation from the ants, or by the thin layers of wood
being acted upon or decomposed by the formic acid.<a name="FNanchor_DE" id="FNanchor_DE"></a><a href="#Footnote_DE" class="fnanchor">[DE]</a> But
if any or all of these causes operated in blackening the wood,
we should be ready to anticipate a similar effect in the case
of other species of ants which inhabit trees; yet the black
tint is only found in the excavations of the jet-ant.</p>

<p>We are acquainted with several colonies of the jet-ants
(<i>Formica fuliginosa</i>)&mdash;one of which, in the roots and trunk of
an oak on the road from Lewisham to Sydenham, near
Brockley, in Kent, is so extremely populous, that the
numbers of its inhabitants appeared to us beyond any
reasonable estimate. None of the other colonies of this
species which we have seen appear to contain many hundreds.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
On cutting into the root of the before-mentioned tree, we
found the vertical excavations of much larger dimensions,
both in width and depth, than those represented by Huber in
the preceding cut (page 302). What surprised us the most
was to see the tree growing vigorously and fresh, though its
roots were chiseled in all directions by legions of workers,
while every leaf, and every inch of the bark, was also
crowded by parties of foragers. On one of the low branches
we found a deserted nest of the white-throat (<i>Sylvia cinerea</i>,
<span class="smcap">Temminck</span>), in the cavity of which they were piled upon one
another as close as the unhappy negroes in the hold of a
slave-ship; but we could not discover what had attracted
them hither. Another dense group, collected on one of the
branches, led us to the discovery of a very singular oak gall,
formed on the bark in the shape of a pointed cone, and
crowded together. It is probable that the juice which they
extracted from these galls was much to their taste. (J. R.)</p>

<p>Beside the jet-ant, several other species exercise the art of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
carpentry,&mdash;nay, what is more wonderful still, they have the
ingenuity to knead up, with spider&rsquo;s-web for a cement, the
chips which they chisel out into a material with which they
construct entire chambers. The species which exercise this
singular art are the Ethiopian (<i>Formica nigra</i>) and the
yellow ant (<i>F. flava</i>).<a name="FNanchor_DF" id="FNanchor_DF"></a><a href="#Footnote_DF" class="fnanchor">[DF]</a></p>

<p>We once observed the dusky ants (<i>F. fusca</i>) at Blackheath,
in Kent, busily employed in carrying out chips from the
interior of a decaying black poplar, at the root of which a
colony was established; but, though it thence appears that
this species can chisel wood if they choose, yet they usually
burrow in the earth, and by preference, as we have remarked,
at the root of a tree, the leaves of which supply them with
food.</p>

<p class="tb_stars">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</p>

<p>Among the foreign ants we may mention a small yellow
ant of South America, described by Dampier, which seems,
from his account, to construct a nest of green leaves. &ldquo;Their
sting,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is like a spark of fire; and they are so thick
among the boughs in some places, that one shall be covered
with them before he is aware. These creatures have nests
on great trees, placed on the body between the limbs: some
of their nests are as big as a hogshead. This is their winter
habitation; for in the wet season they all repair to these
their cities, where they preserve their eggs. In the dry
season, when they leave their nests, they swarm all over the
woodlands, for they never trouble the savannahs. Great
paths, three or four inches broad, made by them, may be
seen in the woods. They go out light, but bring home
heavy loads on their backs, all of the same substance, and
equal in size. I never observed anything besides pieces of
green leaves, so big that I could scarcely see the insect for
his burthen; yet they would march stoutly, and so many
were pressing forward that it was a very pretty sight, for the
path looked perfectly green with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ants observed in New South Wales, by the gentlemen in
the expedition under Captain Cook, are still more interesting.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
&ldquo;Some,&rdquo; we are told, "are as green as a leaf, and live upon
trees, where they build their nests of various sizes, between
that of a man&rsquo;s head and his fist. These nests are of a very
curious structure: they are formed by bending down several
of the leaves, each of which is as broad as a man&rsquo;s hand, and
gluing the points of them together, so as to form a purse.
The viscous matter used for this purpose is an animal juice
which nature has enabled them to elaborate. Their method
of first bending down the leaves we had no opportunity to
observe; but we saw thousands uniting all their strength to
hold them in this position, while other busy multitudes were
employed within in applying this gluten that was to prevent
their returning back. To satisfy ourselves that the leaves
were bent and held down by the efforts of these diminutive
artificers, we disturbed them in their work; and as soon as
they were driven from their stations, the leaves on which
they were employed sprang up with a force much greater
than we could have thought them able to conquer by any
combination of their strength. But, though we gratified our
curiosity at their expense, the injury did not go unrevenged;
for thousands immediately threw themselves upon us, and
gave us intolerable pain with their stings, especially those
which took possession of our necks and hair, from whence
they were not easily driven. Their sting was scarcely less
painful than that of a bee; but, except it was repeated, the
pain did not last more than a minute.</p>

<p>"Another sort are quite black, and their operation and
manner of life are not less extraordinary. Their habitations
are the inside of the branches of a tree, which they contrive
to excavate by working out the pith almost to the extremity
of the slenderest twig, the tree at the same time flourishing
as if it had no such inmate. When we first found the tree
we gathered some of the branches, and were scarcely less
astonished than we should have been to find that we had
profaned a consecrated grove, where every tree, upon being
wounded, gave signs of life; for we were instantly covered
with legions of these animals, swarming from every broken
bough, and inflicting their stings with incessant violence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A third kind we found nested in the root of a plant,
which grows on the bark of trees in the manner of mistletoe,
and which they had perforated for that use. This root is
commonly as big as a large turnip, and sometimes much
bigger. When we cut it we found it intersected by innumerable
winding passages, all filled with these animals, by
which, however, the vegetation of the plant did not appear to
have suffered any injury. We never cut one of these roots
that was not inhabited, though some were not bigger than a
hazel-nut. The animals themselves are very small, not more
than half as big as the common red ant in England. They
had stings, but scarcely force enough to make them felt:
they had, however, a power of tormenting us in an equal, if
not in a greater degree; for the moment we handled the
root, they swarmed from innumerable holes, and running
about those parts of the body that were uncovered, produced
a titillation more intolerable than pain, except it is increased
to great violence.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_DG" id="FNanchor_DG"></a><a href="#Footnote_DG" class="fnanchor">[DG]</a></p>

<p>The species called sugar-ants in the West Indies are
particularly destructive to the sugar-cane, as well as to lime,
lemon, and orange-trees, by excavating their nests at the
roots, and so loosening the earth that they are frequently
uprooted and blown down by the winds. If this does not
happen, the roots are deprived of due nourishment, and the
plants become sickly and die.<a name="FNanchor_DH" id="FNanchor_DH"></a><a href="#Footnote_DH" class="fnanchor">[DH]</a></p>

<p>[One or two examples of foreign ants are well worthy of
notice. The first of them is an insect whose habits bear
strongly upon the familiar passage in Proverbs, ch. vi. v. 6:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This passage is one that has been often mentioned as a
proof that the Bible is not to be implicitly trusted. Judging
from all the species of ants known to entomologists, some
writers argue that the author of the proverb in question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
was ignorant of the real history of the ant, and was taking
up a popular fallacy.</p>

<p>[Still, although the ants of the old world are chiefly
carnivorous, or feed on soft substances, and in consequence
have not the least idea of hoarding food for the winter, there
is one species of Brazilian ant which absolutely builds houses,
prepares ground, sows seed, reaps the grain, and stores it
away for future consumption. It is the Agricultural Ant,
<i>Atta malefaciens</i>, first described by Dr. Lincecum, who watched
the insect for twelve years before publishing an account that
he knew would at first be received with incredulity. The
following abstract of his paper appeared in the Journal of
the Linnæan Society.</p>

<p>"The species which I have named &lsquo;Agricultural&rsquo; is a
large brownish ant. It dwells in what may be termed
paved cities, and like a thrifty, diligent, provident farmer,
makes suitable and timely arrangements for the changing
seasons. It is, in short, endowed with skill, ingenuity, and
untiring patience, sufficient to enable it successfully to
contend with the varying exigencies which it may have to
encounter in the life conflict.</p>

<p>"When it has selected a situation for its habitation, if on
ordinary dry ground, it bores a hole, around which it raises
the surface three and sometimes six inches, forming a low
circular mound, having a very gentle inclination from the
centre to the outer border, which on an average is three or
four feet from the entrance. But if the location is chosen
on low, flat, wet land, liable to inundation, though the
ground may be perfectly dry at the time the ant sets to
work, it nevertheless elevates the mound, in the form of a
pretty sharp cone, to the height of fifteen or twenty inches or
more, and makes the entrance near the summit. Around the
mound, in either case, the ant clears the ground of all
obstructions, and levels and marks the surface to the distance
of three or four feet from the gate of the city, giving the
space the appearance of a handsome pavement, as it really is.</p>

<p>"Within this paved area not a blade of any green thing is
allowed to grow, except a single species of grain-bearing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
grass. Having planted this crop in a circle around, and two
or three feet from the centre of the mound, the insect tends
and cultivates it with constant care, cutting away all other
grasses and weeds that may spring up amongst it, and all
around outside the farm circle to the extent of one or two
feet more. The cultivated grass grows luxuriantly, and
produces a heavy crop of small, white, flinty seeds, which
under the microscope very closely resemble ordinary rice.
When ripe, it is carefully harvested and carried by the
workers, chaff and all, into the granary cells, where it is
divested of the chaff and packed away. The chaff is taken
out and thrown beyond the limits of the paved area.</p>

<p>"During protracted wet weather it sometimes happens
that the provision-stores become damp, and are liable to
sprout and spoil. In this case, on the first fine day, the
ants bring out the damp and damaged grain, and expose it to
the sun till it is dry, when they carry it back and pack away
all the sound seeds, leaving those that had sprouted to waste.</p>

<p>"In a peach orchard not far from my house is a considerable
elevation, on which is an extensive bed of rock. In the
sand-beds overlying portions of this rock are five cities of
the agricultural ants, evidently very ancient. My observations
on their manners and customs have been limited to the
last twelve years, during which time the inclosure surrounding
the orchard has prevented the approach of cattle to the
ant-farms. The cities which are outside the inclosure, as
well as those protected in it, are at the proper season
invariably planted with the ant-rice. The crop may accordingly
always be seen springing up within the circle about
the 1st of November every year. Of late years, however,
since the number of farms and cattle has greatly increased,
and the latter are eating off the grass much closer than
formerly, thus preventing the ripening of the seeds, I notice
that the agricultural ant is placing its cities along the turn-rows
in the fields, walks in gardens, inside about the gates,
&amp;c., where they can cultivate their farms without molestation
from the cattle.</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt that the particular species of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
grain-bearing grass mentioned above is intentionally planted.
In farmer-like manner the ground upon which it stands is
carefully divested of all other grasses and weeds during the
time it is growing. When it is ripe, the grain is taken care
of, the dry stubble cut away and carried off, the paved area
being left unencumbered until the ensuing autumn, when the
same ant-rice reappears within the same circle, and receives
the same agricultural attention as was bestowed upon the
previous crop&mdash;and so on, year after year, as I <i>know</i> to be
the case, in all situations where the ants&rsquo; settlements are
protected from granivorous animals."</p>

<p>This interesting account is simply the result of twelve
years&rsquo; patient investigation on the part of Dr. Lincecum, who
took special care not to invent a theory and to twist facts in
accordance with it, but watched the entire proceedings of the
insects for a series of years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>The preceding illustration represents the rather remarkable
nest of an Australian ant, belonging to the genus Crematogaster.
This word signifies &ldquo;hanging-belly,&rdquo; and the name
has been applied to the ant in consequence of the manner in
which its abdomen is held up in the air, so that it overhangs
the back.</p>

<p>As may be seen, the nest is of considerable size, and might
from its external appearance be mistaken for that of a wasp.
The interior of it, however, is even more elaborate, being
full of little covered passages interlacing with each other
in a most intricate manner, but all leading to the internal
galleries.</p>

<p>The two nests which are shown in the next illustration
are, if possible, still more remarkable.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 474px;">
<img src="images/311.png" width="474" height="442" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The upper one is found in Cayenne, and is made by an
insect called the fungus ant (<i>Polyrachis bispinosa</i>), because
the nest looks as if it were made of fungus. It is not, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
composed of that material, but of the fibre of the cotton-tree
(<i>Bombax ceiba</i>).</p>

<p>The fibre is in itself very short, barely exceeding an inch
in length, but it is cut very much shorter by the ant, who
contrives to felt it together in a most curious manner, so
that it is hardly possible to trace the course of any one fibre.
The size of the nest is, on an average, about eight or nine
inches in diameter. The insect itself is given in the preceding
illustration, but very much enlarged. If the reader will look
at the centre of the body, he will see the projections which
have given it the name of <i>bispinosa</i>, or two-spined.</p>

<p>The lower figure represents the nest of another species of
ant belonging to the same genus, and called scientifically,
<i>Polyrachis textor</i>. The nest is most ingeniously made of
little pieces of wood and tendrils, put together so as to form
a kind of open net-work, through which the interior of the
nest is plainly visible. This insect inhabits Malacca.]</p>

<p class="caption2">STRUCTURES OF WHITE ANTS, OR TERMITES.</p>


<p>When we look back upon the details which we have given of
the industry and ingenuity of numerous tribes of insects,
both solitary and social, we are induced to think it almost
impossible that they could be surpassed. The structures of
wasps and bees, and still more those of the wood-ant (<i>Formica
rufa</i>), when placed in comparison with the size of the insects,
equal our largest cities compared with the stature of
man. But when we look at the buildings erected by the
white ants of tropical climates, all that we have been surveying
dwindles into insignificance. Their industry appears
greatly to surpass that of our ants and bees, and they are
certainly more skilful in architectural contrivances. The
elevation, also, of their edifices is more than five hundred
times the height of the builders. Were our houses built
according to the same proportions, they would be twelve or
fifteen times higher than the London Monument, and four or
five times higher than the pyramids of Egypt, with corresponding
dimensions in the basements of the edifices. These
statements are, perhaps, necessary to impress the extraordinary
labours of ants upon the mind; for we are all more
or less sensible to the force of comparisons. The analogies
between the works of insects and of men are not perfect; for
insects are all provided with instruments peculiarly adapted
to the end which they instinctively seek, while man has to
form a plan by progressive thought, and upon the experience
of others, and to complete it with tools which he also invents.</p>

<p>The termites do not stand above a quarter of an inch high,
while their nests are frequently twelve feet, and Jobson
mentions some which he had seen as high as twenty feet;
&ldquo;of compass,&rdquo; he adds, "to contain a dozen men, with the
heat of the sun baked into that hardness, that we used to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
hide ourselves in the ragged tops of them when we took up
stands to shoot at deer or wild beasts."<a name="FNanchor_DI" id="FNanchor_DI"></a><a href="#Footnote_DI" class="fnanchor">[DI]</a> Bishop Heber saw
a number of these high ant-hills in India, near the principal
entrance of the Sooty or Moorshedabad river. &ldquo;Many of
them,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;were five or six feet high, and probably
seven or eight feet in circumference at the base, partially
overgrown with grass and ivy, and looking at a distance like
the stumps of decayed trees. I think it is Ctesias, among
the Greek writers, who gives an account alluded to by Lucian
in his &lsquo;Cock,&rsquo; of monstrous ants in India, as large as foxes.
The falsehood probably originated in the stupendous fabrics
which they rear here, and which certainly might be supposed
to be the work of a much larger animal than their real
architect.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_DJ" id="FNanchor_DJ"></a><a href="#Footnote_DJ" class="fnanchor">[DJ]</a> Herodotus has a similar fable of the enormous
size and brilliant appearance of the ants of India.</p>

<p>Nor is it only in constructing dwellings for themselves
that the termites of Africa and of other hot climates employ
their masonic skill. Though, like our ants and wasps, they
are almost omnivorous, yet wood, particularly when felled
and dry, seems their favourite article of food; but they have
an utter aversion to feeding in the light, and always eat
their way with all expedition to the interior. It thence
would seem necessary for them either to leave the bark of a
tree, or the outer portion of the beam or door of a house,
undevoured, or to eat in open day. They do neither; but
are at the trouble of constructing galleries of clay, in which
they can conceal themselves, and feed in security. In all
their foraging excursions, indeed, they build covert ways, by
which they can go out and return to their encampment.<a name="FNanchor_DK" id="FNanchor_DK"></a><a href="#Footnote_DK" class="fnanchor">[DK]</a></p>

<p>Others of the species (for there are several), instead of
building galleries, exercise the art of miners, and make their
approaches under ground, penetrating beneath the foundation
of houses or areas, and rising again either through the
floors, or by entering the bottom of the posts that support
the building, when they follow the course of the fibres, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
make their way to the top, boring holes and cavities in different
places as they proceed. Multitudes enter the roof,
and intersect it with pipes or galleries, formed of wet clay,
which serve for passages in all directions, and enable them
more readily to fix their habitations in it. They prefer the
softer woods, such as pine and fir, which they hollow out
with such nicety, that they leave the surface whole, after
having eaten away the inside. A shelf or plank attacked in
this manner looks solid to the eye, when, if weighed, it will
not out-balance two sheets of pasteboard of the same dimensions.
It sometimes happens that they carry this operation
so far on stakes in the open air, as to render the bark too
flexible for their purpose; when they remedy the defect by
plastering the whole stick with a sort of mortar which they
make with clay, so that, on being struck, the form vanishes,
and the artificial covering falls in fragments on the ground.
In the woods, when a large tree falls from age or accident,
they enter it on the side next the ground, and devour it at
leisure, till little more than the bark is left. But in this
case they take no precaution of strengthening the outward
defence, but leave it in such a state as to deceive an eye
unaccustomed to see trees thus gutted of their insides: and
&ldquo;you may as well,&rdquo; says Mr. Smeathman, &ldquo;step upon a
cloud.&rdquo; It is an extraordinary fact, that when these creatures
have formed pipes in the roof of a house, instinct
directs them to prevent its fall, which would ensue from
their having sapped the posts on which it rests; but as they
gnaw away the wood, they fill up the interstices with clay,
tempered to a surprising degree of hardness, so that, when
the house is pulled down, these posts are transformed from
wood to stone. They make the walls of their galleries of
the same composition as their nests, varying the materials
according to their kind; one species using the red clay,
another black clay, and the third a woody substance,
cemented with gums, as a security from the attacks of their
enemies, particularly the common ant, which, being defended
by a strong, horny shell, is more than a match for them,
and when it can get at them, rapaciously seizes them, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
drags them to its nest for food for its young brood. If any
accident breaks down part of their walls, they repair the
breach with all speed. Instinct guides them to perform
their office in the creation, by mostly confining their attacks
to trees that are beginning to decay, or such timber as has
been severed from its roots for use, and would decay in time.
Vigorous, healthy trees do not require to be destroyed, and
accordingly, these consumers have no taste for them.<a name="FNanchor_DL" id="FNanchor_DL"></a><a href="#Footnote_DL" class="fnanchor">[DL]</a></p>

<p>M. Adanson describes the termites of Senegal as constructing
covert ways along the surface of wood which they
intend to attack; but though we have no reason to distrust
so excellent a naturalist, in describing what he saw, it is
certain that they more commonly eat their way into the
interior of the wood, and afterwards form the galleries, when
they find that they have destroyed the wood till it will no
longer afford them protection.</p>

<p>But it is time that we should come to their principal
building, which may, with some propriety, be called a city;
and, according to the method we have followed in other
instances, we shall trace their labours from the commencement.
We shall begin with the operations of the species
which may be appropriately termed the Warrior (<i>Termes
fatalis</i>, <span class="smcap">Linn.</span>; <i>T. bellicosus</i>, <span class="smcap">Smeath.</span>).</p>

<p>We must premise, that though they have been termed
white <i>ants</i>, they do not belong to the same order of insects
with our ants; yet they have a slight resemblance to ants in
their form, but more in their economy. Smeathman, to
whom we owe our chief knowledge of the genus, describes
them as consisting of kings, queens, soldiers, and workers,
and is of opinion that the workers are larvæ, the soldiers
nymphæ, and the kings and queens the perfect insects. In
this opinion he coincides with Sparrmann<a name="FNanchor_DM" id="FNanchor_DM"></a><a href="#Footnote_DM" class="fnanchor">[DM]</a> and others; but
Latreille is inclined to think, from what he observed in a
European species (<i>Termes lucifugus</i>) found near Bordeaux,
that the soldiers form a distinct race, like the neuter workers
among bees and ants, while the working termites are larvæ,<a name="FNanchor_DN" id="FNanchor_DN"></a><a href="#Footnote_DN" class="fnanchor">[DN]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
which are furnished with strong mandibles for gnawing;
when they become nymphs, the rudiments of four wings
appear, which are fully developed in the perfect insects.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 417px;">
<img src="images/317.png" width="417" height="144" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Termes bellicosus in the winged state.</span>
</div>

<p>[It is now known that the differences of form among the
termites are accounted for as follows. The winged specimens
are the fully developed males and females, popularly called
kings and queens. These crawl to the aperture of their
house and take flight, retiring to earth after a short time.
When a male and female meet each other, they cast off their
wings exactly as do the ants of our own country, and become
the founders of a new colony. Their soldiers are undeveloped
males, and the workers are undeveloped females.]</p>

<p>In the winged state, they migrate to form new colonies,
but the greater number of them perish in a few hours, or
become the prey of birds, and even of the natives, who fry them
as delicacies. &ldquo;I have discoursed with several gentlemen,&rdquo;
says Smeathman, &ldquo;upon the taste of the white ants, and on
comparing notes, we have always agreed that they are most
delicious and delicate eating. One gentleman compared
them to sugared marrow, another to sugared cream and a
paste of sweet almonds.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_DO" id="FNanchor_DO"></a><a href="#Footnote_DO" class="fnanchor">[DO]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Smeathman&rsquo;s very interesting paper affords us the
most authentic materials for the further description of these
wonderful insects; and we therefore continue partly to extract
from, and partly to abridge, his account.</p>

<p>The few pairs that are so fortunate as to survive the
various casualties that assail them, are usually found by
workers (larvæ), which, at this season, are running continually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
on the surface of the ground, on the watch for them.
As soon as they discover the objects of their search, they
begin to protect them from their surrounding enemies, by
inclosing them in a small chamber of clay, where they
become the parents of a new community, and are distinguished
from the other inhabitants of the nest by the title of
king and queen. Instinct directs the attention of these
labouring insects to the preservation of their race, in the
protection of this pair and their offspring. The chamber
that forms the rudiment of a new nest is contrived for their
safety, but the entrances to it are too small to admit of their
ever leaving it; consequently, the charge of the eggs devolves
upon the labourers, who construct nurseries for their
reception. These are small, irregularly-shaped chambers,
placed at first round the apartment of the king and queen,
and not exceeding the size of a hazel-nut; but in nests of
long standing they are of great comparative magnitude, and
distributed at a greater distance. The receptacles for hatching
the young are all composed of wooden materials, apparently
joined together with gum, and, by way of defence,
cased with clay. The chamber that contains the king and
queen is nearly on a level with the surface of the ground;
and as the other apartments are formed about it, it is generally
situated at an equal distance from the sides of the nest,
and directly beneath its conical point. Those apartments
which consist of nurseries and magazines of provisions, form
an intricate labyrinth, being separated by small, empty
chambers and galleries, which surround them, or afford a
communication from one to another. This labyrinth extends
on all sides to the outward shells, and reaches up within it
to two-thirds or more of its height, leaving an open area
above, in the middle, under the dome, which reminds the
spectator of the nave of an old cathedral. Around this are
raised three or four large arches, which are sometimes two
or three feet high, next the front of the area, but diminish as
they recede further back, and are lost amidst the innumerable
chambers and nurseries behind them.</p>

<p>Every one of these buildings consists of two distinct parts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
the exterior and the interior. The exterior is one large
shell, in the manner of a dome, large and strong enough to
inclose and shelter the interior from the vicissitudes of the
weather, and the inhabitants from the attacks of natural or
accidental enemies. It is always, therefore, much stronger
than the interior building, which is the habitable part,
divided, with a wonderful kind of regularity and contrivance,
into an amazing number of apartments for the residence of
the king and queen, and the nursing of the numerous progeny;
or for magazines, which are always found well filled
with stores and provisions. The hills make their first
appearance above ground by a little turret or two, in the
shape of sugar-loaves, which are run a foot high or more.
Soon after, at some little distance, while the former are
increasing in height and size, they raise others, and so go on
increasing their number, and widening them at the base, till
their works below are covered with these turrets, of which
they always raise the highest and largest in the middle, and
by filling up the intervals between each turret, collect them
into one dome. They are not very curious or exact in the
workmanship, except in making them very solid and strong;
and when, by their joining them, the dome is completed, for
which purpose the turrets answer as scaffolds, they take away
the middle ones entirely, except the tops, which, joined
together, make the crown of the cupola, and apply the clay
to the building of the works within, or to erecting fresh
turrets for the purpose of raising the hillock still higher; so
that some part of the clay is probably used several times,
like the boards and posts of a mason&rsquo;s scaffold.</p>

<p>When these hills are little more than half their height,
it is a common practice of the wild bulls to stand as sentinels
on them, while the rest of the herd are ruminating below.
They are sufficiently strong for that purpose, and at their
full height answer excellently well as places of look-out;
and Mr. Smeathman has been, with four more, on the top of
one of these hillocks, to watch for a vessel in sight. The
outward shell, or dome, is not only of use to protect and
support the interior buildings from external violence and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
the heavy rains, but to collect and preserve a regular degree
of the warmth and moisture necessary for hatching the eggs
and cherishing the young. The royal chamber occupied by
the king and queen appears to be, in the opinion of this
little people, of the most consequence, being always situated
as near the centre of the interior building as possible. It is
always nearly in the shape of half an egg, or an obtuse oval,
within, and may be supposed to represent a long oven. In
the infant state of the colony it is but about an inch in
length; but in time will be increased to six or eight inches,
or more, in the clear, being always in proportion to the size
of the queen, who, increasing in bulk as in age, at length
requires a chamber of such dimensions.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 442px;">
<img src="images/320.png" width="442" height="134" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Queen distended with Eggs.</span>
</div>

<p>Its floor is perfectly horizontal, and in large hillocks,
sometimes more than an inch thick of solid clay. The
roof, also, which is one solid and well-turned oval arch, is
generally of about the same solidity; but in some places it
is not a quarter of an inch thick on the sides where it joins
the floor, and where the doors or entrances are made level
with it, at nearly equal distances from each other. These
entrances will not admit any animal larger than the soldiers
or labourers; so that the king and the queen (who is, at full
size, a thousand times the weight of a king) can never
possibly go out, but remain close prisoners.</p>

<p>[There is a good series of the queen cells of the Termite in
the British Museum, and the reader is strongly recommended
to go and examine them. Some of them are as large as
cocoa-nuts. Around the cell are a number of small holes,
looking as if they had been bored with a bradawl. Now, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
the cell be carefully opened, a most curious arrangement will
be seen. Each of the little holes serves as an opening into
a passage which communicates with the interior of the cell.
The apartment, if we may so call it, which contains the queen,
is only just large enough to hold her, and there is no door
or opening for her egress. This, however, is not required,
as her enormous size prevents her from moving. Through
these passages runs incessantly a stream of worker termites,
some of them carrying eggs which the queen has just laid, and
others returning to the royal chamber for a fresh supply.]</p>

<p>The royal chamber, if in a large hillock, is surrounded by
a countless number of others, of different sizes, shapes, and
dimensions; but all of them arched in one way or another&mdash;sometimes
elliptical or oval. These either open into each
other, or communicate by passages as wide as, and are
evidently made for, the soldiers and attendants, of whom
great numbers are necessary, and always in waiting. These
apartments are joined by the magazines and nurseries. The
former are chambers of clay, and are always well filled with
provisions, which, to the naked eye, seem to consist of the
raspings of wood, and plants which the termites destroy, but
are found by the microscope to be principally the gums or
inspissated juices of plants. These are thrown together in
little masses, some of which are finer than others, and
resemble the sugar about preserved fruits; others are like
tears of gum, one quite transparent, another like amber, a
third brown, and a fourth quite opaque, as we see often in
parcels of ordinary gums. These magazines are intermixed
with the nurseries, which are buildings totally different from
the rest of the apartments; for these are composed entirely
of wooden materials, seemingly joined together with gums.
Mr. Smeathman calls them the nurseries because they are
invariably occupied by the eggs and young ones, which
appear at first in the shape of labourers, but white as snow.
These buildings are exceedingly compact, and divided into
many very small irregular-shaped chambers, not one of which
is to be found of half an inch in width. They are placed all
round, and as near as possible to the royal apartments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>When the nest is in the infant state, the nurseries are
close to the royal chambers; but as, in process of time, the
queen enlarges, it is necessary to enlarge the chamber for her
accommodation; and as she then lays a greater number of
eggs, and requires a greater number of attendants, so it is
necessary to enlarge and increase the number of the adjacent
apartments; for which purpose the small nurseries which are
first built are taken to pieces, rebuilt a little further of a size
larger, and the number of them increased at the same time.
Thus they continually enlarge their apartments, pull down,
repair, or rebuild, according to their wants, with a degree of
sagacity, regularity, and foresight, not even imitated by any
other kind of animals or insects.</p>

<p>All these chambers, and the passages leading to and from
them, being arched, they help to support each other; and
while the interior large arches prevent them from falling into
the centre, and keep the area open, the exterior building
supports them on the outside. There are, comparatively
speaking, few openings into the great area, and they, for the
most part, seem intended only to admit into the nurseries
that genial warmth which the dome collects. The interior
building, or assemblage of nurseries, chambers, &amp;c., has a
flattish top or roof, without any perforation, which would
keep the apartments below dry, in case through accident the
dome should receive any injury, and let in water; and it is
never exactly flat and uniform, because the insects are always
adding to it by building more chambers and nurseries; so
that the division or columns between the future arched apartment
resemble the pinnacles on the fronts of some old
buildings, and demand particular notice, as affording one
proof that for the most part the insects project their arches,
and do not make them by excavation. The area has also a
flattish floor, which lies over the royal chamber, but sometimes
a good height above it, having nurseries and magazines
between. It is likewise waterproof, and contrived to let the
water off if it should get in, and run over by some short way
into the subterraneous passages, which run under the lowest
apartments in the hill in various directions, and are of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
astonishing size, being wider than the bore of a great cannon.
One that Mr. Smeathman measured was perfectly cylindrical,
and thirteen inches in diameter. These subterraneous passages,
or galleries, are lined very thick with the same kind
of clay of which the hill is composed, and ascend the inside
of the outward shell in a spiral manner; and winding round
the whole building up to the top, intersect each other at
different heights, opening either immediately in the dome in
various places, and into the interior building, the new turrets,
&amp;c., or communicating with them by other galleries of different
diameters, either circular or oval.</p>

<p>From every part of these large galleries are various small
covert ways, or galleries leading to different parts of the
building. Under ground there are a great many that lead
downward by sloping descents, three and four feet perpendicular
among the gravel, whence the workers cull the finer
parts, which, being kneaded up in their mouths to the consistence
of mortar, become that solid clay or stone of which
their hills and all their buildings, except their nurseries, are
composed. Other galleries again ascend, and lead out horizontally
on every side, and are carried under ground near to
the surface a vast distance: for if all the nests are destroyed
within a hundred yards of a house, the inhabitants of those
which are left unmolested farther off will still carry on their
subterraneous galleries, and, invading it by sap and mine, do
great mischief to the goods and merchandise contained in it.</p>

<p>It seems there is a degree of necessity for the galleries
under the hills being thus large, since they are the great
thoroughfares for all the labourers and soldiers going forth
or returning, whether fetching clay, wood, water, or provisions;
and they are certainly well calculated for the
purposes to which they are applied by the spiral slope which
is given them; for if they were perpendicular the labourers
would not be able to carry on their building with so much
facility, as they ascend a perpendicular with great difficulty,
and the soldiers can scarcely do it at all. It is on this
account that sometimes a road like a ledge is made on the
perpendicular side of any part of the building within their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
hill, which is flat on the upper surface and half an inch wide,
and ascends gradually like a staircase, or like those winding
roads which are cut on the sides of hills and mountains, that
would otherwise be inaccessible; by which and similar contrivances
they travel with great facility to every interior
part.</p>

<span class="fig_caption"><i>a</i>, A covered way and nest, on the branch of a tree, of the <i>Termites arborum</i>. <i>b</i>, Section of the Hill-nest

</div>

<p>This, too, is probably the cause of their building a kind of
bridge of one great arch, which answers the purpose of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
flight of stairs from the floor of the area to some opening on
the side of one of the columns that support the great arches.
This contrivance must shorten the distance exceedingly to
those labourers who have the eggs to carry from the royal
chamber to some of the upper nurseries, which in some hills
would be four or five feet in the straightest line, and much
more if carried through all the winding passages leading
through the inner chambers and apartments. Mr. Smeathman
found one of these bridges, half an inch broad, a quarter
of an inch thick, and ten inches long, making the side of an
elliptic arch of proportionable size; so that it is wonderful
it did not fall over or break by its own weight before they
got it joined to the side of the column above.</p>

<p>It was strengthened by a small arch at the bottom, and
had a hollow or groove all the length of the upper surface,
either made purposely for the inhabitants to travel over
with more safety, or else, which is not improbable, worn
by frequent treading.</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Turret-building White Ants.</p>

<p>Apparently more than one species smaller than the preceding,
such as the <i>Termes mordax</i> and <i>T. atrox</i> of Smeathman,
construct nests of a very different form, the figures of
which resemble a pillar, with a large mushroom for a capital.
These turrets are composed of well-tempered black earth, and
stand nearly three feet high. The conical mushroom-shaped
roof is composed of the same material, and the brims hang
over the column, being three or four inches wider than its
perpendicular sides. Most of them, says Smeathman, resemble
in shape the body of a round windmill, but some of
the roofs have little elevation in the middle. When one of
these turrets is completed, the insects do not afterwards enlarge
or alter it; but if it be found too small for them, they
lay the foundation of another at a few inches&rsquo; distance.
They sometimes, but not often, begin the second before the
first is finished, and a third before they have completed the
second. Five or six of these singular turrets in a group may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
be seen in the thick woods at the foot of a tree. They are
so very strongly built, that in case of violence, they will
sooner tear up the gravel and solid heart of their foundation
than break in the middle. When any of them happen to be
thus thrown down, the insects do not abandon them; but,
using their overturned column as a basis, they run up another
perpendicularly from it to the usual height, fastening the
under part at the same time to the ground, to render it the
more secure.</p>

<p>The interior of a turret is pretty equally divided into innumerable
cells, irregular in shape, but usually more or
less angular, generally quadrangular or pentagonal, though
the angles are not well defined. Each shell has at least
two entrances; but there are no galleries, arches, nor
wooden nurseries, as in the nests of the warrior (<i>T. bellicosus</i>).
The two species which build turret nests are very
different in size, and the dimensions of the nests differ in
proportion.</p>

part lying on the ground.</span>
</div>


<p class="caption3 smcap">The White Ants of Trees.</p>

<p>Latreille&rsquo;s species of white ant (<i>Termes lucifugus</i>, <span class="smcap">Rossi</span>),
formerly mentioned as found in the south of Europe, appear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
to have more the habits of the jet-ant, described page 301,
than their congeners of the tropics. They live in the
interior of the trunks of trees, the wood of which they eat,
and form their habitations of the galleries which they thus
excavate. M. Latreille says they appear to be furnished
with an acid for the purpose of softening the wood, the odour
of which is exceedingly pungent. They prefer the part of
the wood nearest to the bark, which they are careful not to
injure, as it affords them protection. All the walls of their
galleries are moistened with small globules of a gelatinous
substance, similar to gum Arabic. They are chiefly to be
found in the trunks of oak and pine trees, and are very
numerous.<a name="FNanchor_DP" id="FNanchor_DP"></a><a href="#Footnote_DP" class="fnanchor">[DP]</a></p>

<p>Another of the species (<i>Termes arborum</i>), described by
Smeathman, builds a nest on the exterior of trees, altogether
different from any of the preceding. These are of a spherical
or oval shape, occupying the arm or branch of a tree
sometimes from seventy to eighty feet from the ground, and
as large, in a few instances, as a sugar-cask. The composition
used for a building material is apparently similar to
that used by the warriors for constructing their nurseries,
being the gnawings of wood in very small particles, kneaded
into a paste with some species of cement or glue, procured,
as Smeathman supposes, partly from gummiferous trees, and
partly from themselves; but it is more probable, we think,
that it is wholly secreted, like the wax of bees, by the insects
themselves. With this cement, whatever may be its composition,
they construct their cells, in which there is nothing
very wonderful except their great numbers. They are very
firmly built, and so strongly attached to the trees, that they
will resist the most violent tornado. It is impossible, indeed,
to detach them, except by cutting them in pieces, or sawing
off the branch, which is frequently done to procure the
insects for young turkeys. (See engraving, <a href="#Page_324">p. 324</a>, for a
figure of this nest.)</p>

<p>This species very often, instead of selecting the bough of a
tree, builds in the roof or wall of a house, and unless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
observed in time, and expelled, occasions considerable damage.
It is easier, in fact, to shut one&rsquo;s door against a fox or a thief,
than to exclude such insidious enemies, whose aversion to
light renders it difficult to trace them even when they are
numerous.</p>

<p>[There are also termites in Europe, and the city of La
Rochelle has suffered terribly from them. They eat the
trees in the gardens, and not a stake can be driven into the
ground, or even a plank left for twenty-four hours, without
being attacked. They also enter the houses and utterly ruin
them by eating every bit of timber that is used in them.
In one instance, where a room had been repaired, the stalactitic
galleries of the termites showed themselves the very day
after the workmen had left the room.</p>

<p>They invaded the prefecture, and did exceeding damage,
one of their feats of voracity being so extraordinary as to
deserve mention. The archives of the department were left
in boxes, and privately inspected. One day, when a paper
was needed, the whole of the documents fell to pieces, and
were metamorphosed as if by magic into a heap of clay. The
termites had got into the boxes by boring through the
wainscot of the room, and had then penetrated among the
papers. They consumed every particle of them except the
uppermost sheet and the edges, supplying their place with
clay. The consequence was, that although the heap of
documents seemed to be correct, there was nothing but a
mass of clay galleries and a single sheet of paper at
the top.</p>

<p>So voracious are they, that even a piece of paper wrapped
round a bottle was eaten, the termites building a gallery of
clay in order to reach it under cover.]</p>

<p>If we reflect on the prodigious numbers of those insects,
and their power and rapidity of destroying, we cannot but
admire the wisdom of Providence in creating so indefatigable
and useful an agent in countries where the decay of vegetable
substances is rapid in proportion to the heat of the climate.
We have already remarked that they always prefer decaying
or dead timber; and it is indeed a very general law among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
insects which feed on wood to prefer what is unsound; the
same principle holds with respect to fungi, lichens, and other
parasitical plants.</p>

<p>All the species of Termites are not social; but the solitary
ones do not, like their congeners, distinguish themselves in
architecture. In other respects, their habits are more similar;
for they destroy almost every substance, animal and
vegetable. The most common of the solitary species must
be familiar to all our readers by the name of wood-louse
(<i>Termes pulsatorium</i>, <span class="smcap">Linn.</span>; <i>Atropos lignarius</i>, <span class="smcap">Leach</span>)&mdash;one
of the insects which produces the ticking superstitiously
termed the <i>death-watch</i>. It is not so large as the common wood-louse,
but whiter and more slender, having a red mouth and
yellow eyes. It lives in old books, the paper on walls, collections
of insects and dried plants, and is extremely agile in
its movements, darting, by jerks, into dark corners for the
purpose of concealment. It does not like to run straight
forward without resting every half-second, as if to listen or
look about for its pursuer, and at such resting times it is
easily taken. The ticking noise is made by the insect beating
against the wood with its head, and it is supposed by some
to be peculiar to the female, and to be connected with the
laying of her eggs. M. Latreille, however, thinks that the
wood-louse is only the grub of the <i>Psocus abdominalis</i>, in
which case it could not lay eggs; but this opinion is somewhat
questionable. Another death-watch is a small beetle
(<i>Anobium tesselatum</i>).</p>

SILK-WORM.</p>

</div></div>


<p>All the caterpillars of butterflies, moths, and, in general,
of insects with four wings, are capable of spinning silk;
of various degrees of fineness and strength, and differing in
colour, but usually white, yellow, brown, black, or grey.
This is not only of advantage in constructing nests for themselves,
and particularly for their pupæ, as we have so
frequently exemplified in the preceding pages, but it enables
them, the instant they are excluded from the egg, to protect
themselves from innumerable accidents, as well as from
enemies. If a caterpillar, for instance, be exposed to a gust
of wind, and blown off from its native tree, it lets itself
gently down, and breaks its fall, by immediately spinning a
cable of silk, along which, also, it can reascend to its former
station when the danger is over. In the same way it frequently
disappoints a bird that has marked it out for prey,
by dropping hurriedly down from a branch, suspended to its
never-failing delicate cord. The leaf-rollers, formerly described,
have the advantage of other caterpillars in such cases,
by being able to move as quickly backwards as forwards; so
that when a bird puts in its bill at one end of the roll, the
insect makes a ready exit at the other, and drops along its
thread as low as it judges convenient. We have seen caterpillars
drop in this way from one to six feet or more; and
by means of their cable, which they are careful not to break,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
they climb back with great expedition to their former
place.</p>

<p>The structure of their legs is well adapted for climbing
up their singular rope&mdash;the six fore-legs being furnished
with a curved claw; while the pro-legs (as they have been
termed) are no less fitted for holding them firm to the
branch when they have regained it, being constructed on the
principle of forming a vacuum, like the leather sucker with
which boys lift and drag stones. The foot of the common
fly has a similar sucker, by which it is enabled to walk on
glass, and otherwise support itself against gravity. The
different forms of the leg and pro-leg of a spinning caterpillar
are represented in the figure.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 403px;">
<img src="images/331.png" width="403" height="198" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Leg and Pro-leg of a Caterpillar, greatly magnified.</span>
</div>

<p>In order to understand the nature of the apparatus by
which a caterpillar spins its silk, it is to be recollected that
its whole interior structure differs from that of warm-blooded
animals. It has, properly speaking, no heart, though a long
tubular <i>dorsal vessel</i>, which runs along the back, and pulsates
from twenty to one hundred times per minute, has been called
so by Malpighi and others, but neither Lyonnet nor Cuvier
could detect any vessel issuing from it, and consequently
the fluid which is analogous to blood has no circulation.
It differs also from the higher orders of animals in having
no brain, the nerves running along the body being only
united by little knobs, called ganglions. Another circumstance
is, that it has no lungs, and does not breathe by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
mouth, but by air-holes, or spiracles, eighteen in number,
situated along the sides, in the middle of the rings, as may
be seen in the following figure from Lyonnet.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 420px;">

A, silk bags; B, silk tube, through which the viscid matter, of which the silk threads are
formed, is forced by a peristaltic motion; C, stomach; D D, intestines, with the coil of bile vessels.</span>
</div>

<p>These spiracles communicate on each side with tubes, that
have been called the wind-pipes (<i>tracheæ</i>). The spinning
apparatus is placed near the mouth, and is connected with
the silk-bags, which are long, slender, floating vessels, containing
a liquid gum. The bags are closed at their lower
extremity, become wider towards the middle, and more slender
towards the head, where they unite to form the spinning-tube,
or spinneret. The bags being in most cases longer
than the body of the caterpillar, necessarily lie in a convoluted
state, like the intestines of quadrupeds. The capacity,
or rather the length, of the silk-bags is in proportion to the
quantity of silk required for spinning; the <i>Cossus ligniperda</i>,
for example, from living in the wood of trees spins little,
having a bag only one-fourth the length of that of the silk-worm,
though the caterpillar is at least twice the dimensions
of the latter. The following figure, taken from the admirable
treatise of Lyonnet on the anatomy of the <i>Cossus</i>, will render
these several organs more easily understood than any description.</p>

<p>The spinneret itself was supposed by Réaumur to have
two outlets for the silk; but Lyonnet, upon minute dissection,
found that the two tubes united into one before their termination;
and he also assured himself that it was composed
of alternate slips of horny and membranaceous substance,&mdash;the
one for pressing the thread into a small diameter, and the
other for enlarging it at the insect&rsquo;s pleasure. It is cut at

which it may be required to attach silk. The following are

<p>&ldquo;You may sometimes have seen,&rdquo; says the Abbé de la
Pluche, "in the work-rooms of goldsmiths or gold wire-drawers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
certain iron plates, pierced with holes of different
calibres, through which they draw gold and silver wire, in
order to render it finer. The silk-worm has under her
mouth such a kind of instrument, perforated with a pair of
holes [united into one on the outside<a name="FNanchor_DQ" id="FNanchor_DQ"></a><a href="#Footnote_DQ" class="fnanchor">[DQ]</a>,] through which she
draws two drops of the gum that fills her two bags. These
instruments are like a pair of distaffs for spinning the gum
into a silken thread. She fixes the first drop of gum that
issues where she pleases, and then draws back her head, or
lets herself fall, while the gum, continuing to flow, is drawn
out and lengthened into a double stream. Upon being
exposed to the air, it immediately loses its fluidity, becomes
dry, and acquires consistence and strength. She is never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
deceived in adjusting the dimensions of the [united] apertures,
or in calculating the proper thickness of the thread,
but invariably makes the strength of it proportionable to the
weight of her body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be a very curious thing to know how the gum
which composes the silk is separated and drawn off from the
other juices that nourish the animal. It must be accomplished
like the secretions formed by glands in the human body. I
am therefore persuaded that the gum-bags of the silk-worm
are furnished with a set of minute glands, which being
impregnated with gum, afford a free passage to all the juices
of the mulberry-leaf corresponding with this glutinous
matter, while they exclude every fluid of a different quality.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_DR" id="FNanchor_DR"></a><a href="#Footnote_DR" class="fnanchor">[DR]</a>
When confined in an open glass vessel, the goat-moth caterpillar
will effect its escape by constructing a curious silken
ladder, as represented by Roesel.</p>

<p>Caterpillars, as they increase in size, cast their skins as
lobsters do their shells, and emerge into renewed activity
under an enlarged covering. Previous to this change, when
the skin begins to gird and pinch them, they may be observed
to become languid, and indifferent to their food, and at
length they cease to eat, and await the sloughing of their
skin. It is now that the faculty of spinning silk seems to
be of great advantage to them; for, being rendered inactive
and helpless by the tightening of the old skin around their
expanding body, they might be swept away by the first puff
of wind, and made prey of by ground beetles or other
carnivorous prowlers. To guard against such accidents, as
soon as they feel that they can swallow no more food, from
being half choked by the old skin, they take care to secure
themselves from danger by moorings of silk spun upon the
leaf or the branch where they may be reposing. The caterpillar
of the white satin-moth (<i>Leucoma salicis</i>, <span class="smcap">Stephens</span>) in
this way draws together with silk one or two leaves, similar
to the leaf-rollers (<i>Tortricidæ</i>), though it always feeds openly
without any covering. The caterpillar of the puss-moth
again, which, in its third skin, is large and heavy, spins a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
thick web on the upper surface of a leaf, to which it adheres
till the change is effected.</p>

<p>The most important operation, however, of silk-spinning is
performed before the caterpillar is transformed into a chrysalis,
and is most remarkable in the caterpillars of moths and
other four-winged flies, with the exception of those of butterflies;
for though these exhibit, perhaps, greater ingenuity,
they seldom spin more than a few threads to secure the
chrysalis from falling, whereas the others spin for it a complete
envelope or shroud. We have already seen, in the preceding
pages, several striking instances of this operation, when, probably
for the purpose of husbanding a scanty supply of silk,
extraneous substances are worked into the texture. In the
case of other caterpillars, silk is the only material employed.</p>

<p>Of this the cocoon of the silk-worm is the most prominent
example, in consequence of its importance in our manufactures
and commerce, and on that account will demand from
us somewhat minute details, though it would require volumes
to incorporate all the information which has been published
on the subject.</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Silk-Worm.</p>

<p>The silk-worm, like most other caterpillars, changes its
skin four times during its growth. The intervals at which
the four moultings follow each other depend much on
climate or temperature, as well as on the quality and
quantity of food. It is thence found, that if they are
exposed to a high temperature, say from 81&deg; to 100&deg; Fahrenheit,
the moultings will be hastened; and only five days
will be consumed in moulting the third or fourth time,
whilst those worms that have not been hastened take seven or
eight days.<a name="FNanchor_DS" id="FNanchor_DS"></a><a href="#Footnote_DS" class="fnanchor">[DS]</a></p>

<p>The period of the moultings is also influenced by the
temperature in which the eggs have been kept during the
winter. When the heat of the apartment has been regulated,
the first moulting takes place on the fourth or fifth day after
hatching, the second begins on the eighth day, the third
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
takes up the thirteenth and fourteenth days, and the last
occurs on the twenty-second and twenty-third days. The
fifth age, in such cases, lasts ten days, at the end of which,
or thirty-two days after hatching, the caterpillars attain
their full growth, and ought to be three inches in length;
but if they have not been properly fed, they will not be so
long.</p>

<p>With the age of the caterpillar, its appetite increases,
and is at its maximum after the fourth moulting, when it
also attains its greatest size. The silk gum is then elaborated
in the reservoirs, while the caterpillar ceases to eat, and
soon diminishes again in size and weight. This usually
requires a period of nine or ten days, commencing from the
fourth moulting, after which it begins to spin its shroud of
silk. In this operation it proceeds with the greatest caution,
looking carefully for a spot in which it may be most secure
from interruption.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We usually,&rdquo; says the Abbé de la Pluche, "give it some
little stalks of broom, heath, or a piece of paper rolled up,
into which it retires, and begins to move its head to different
places, in order to fasten its thread on every side. All this
work, though it looks to a bystander like confusion, is not
without design. The caterpillar neither arranges its threads
nor disposes one over another, but contents itself with distending
a sort of cotton or floss to keep off the rain; for Nature
having ordained silk-worms to work under trees, they never
change their method even when they are reared in our houses.</p>

<p>"When my curiosity led me to know how they spun and
placed their beautiful silk, I took one of them, and frequently
removed the floss with which it first attempted to make
itself a covering; and as by this means I weakened it exceedingly,
when it at last became tired of beginning anew, it
fastened its threads on the first thing it encountered, and
began to spin very regularly in my presence, bending its
head up and down, and crossing to every side. It soon
confined its movements to a very contracted space, and, by
degrees, entirely surrounded itself with silk; and the remainder
of its operations became invisible, though these may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
be understood from examining the work after it is finished.
In order to complete the structure, it must draw out of the
gum-bag a more delicate silk, and then with a stronger gum
bind all the inner threads over one another.</p>

<p>"Here, then, are three coverings entirely different, which
afford a succession of shelter. The outer loose silk, or floss,
is for keeping off the rain; the fine silk in the middle prevents
the wind from causing injury; and the glued silk, which
composes the tapestry of the chamber where the insect
lodges, repels both air and water, and prevents the intrusion
of cold.</p>

<p>"After building her cocoon, she divests herself of her
fourth skin, and is transformed into a chrysalis, and subsequently
into a moth (<i>Bombyx mori</i>), when, without saw or
centre-bit, she makes her way through the shell, the silk, and
the floss; for the Being who teaches her how to build herself
a place of rest, where the delicate limbs of the moth may be
formed without interruption, instructs her likewise how to
open a passage for escape.</p>

<p>"The cocoon is like a pigeon&rsquo;s egg, and more pointed at
one end than the other; and it is remarkable that the caterpillar
does not interweave its silk towards the pointed end,
nor apply its glue there as it does in every other part,<a name="FNanchor_DT" id="FNanchor_DT"></a><a href="#Footnote_DT" class="fnanchor">[DT]</a> by
bending itself all around with great pliantness and agility:
what is more, she never fails, when her labour is finished, to
fix her head opposite to the pointed extremity. The reason
of her taking this position is, that she has purposely left this
part less strongly cemented, and less exactly closed. She is
instinctively conscious that this is to be the passage for the
perfect insect which she carries in her bowels, and has therefore
the additional precaution never to place this pointed
extremity against any substance that might obstruct the moth
at the period of its egress.</p>

<p>"When the caterpillar has exhausted herself to furnish
the labour and materials of the three coverings, she loses the
form of a worm; her spoils drop all around the chrysalis;
first throwing off the skin, with the head and jaws attached to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
it, and the new skin hardening into a sort of leathery consistence.
Its nourishment is already in its stomach, and
consists of a yellowish mucus, but gradually the rudiments of
the moth unfold themselves,&mdash;the wings, the antennæ, and
the legs becoming solid. In about a fortnight or three weeks,
a slight swelling in the chrysalis may be remarked, which at
length produces a rupture in the membrane that covers it,
and by repeated efforts the moth bursts through the leathery
envelope into the chamber of the cocoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The moth then extends her antennæ, together with her
head and feet, towards the point of the cone, which not
being thickly closed up in that part gradually yields to her
efforts; she enlarges the opening, and at last comes forth,
leaving at the bottom of the cone the ruins of its former
state&mdash;namely, the head and entire skin of the caterpillar,
which bear some resemblance to a heap of foul linen.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_DU" id="FNanchor_DU"></a><a href="#Footnote_DU" class="fnanchor">[DU]</a></p>

<p>Réaumur was of opinion that the moth makes use of its
eyes as a file, in order to effect its passage through the silk;
while Malpighi, Peck, and others, believe that it is assisted
by an acid which it discharges in order to dissolve the gum
that holds the fibres of the silk together (see <a href="#Page_338">p. 338</a>). Mr.
Swayne denies that the threads are broken at all, either by
filing or solution; for he succeeded in unwinding a whole
cocoon from which the moth had escaped. The soiling of the
cocoon by a fluid, however, we may remark, is no proof of the
acid; for all moths and butterflies discharge a fluid when
they assume wings, whether they be inclosed in a cocoon or
not; but it gives no little plausibility to the opinion, that
&ldquo;the end of the cocoon is observed to be wetted for an hour,
and sometimes several hours, before the moth makes its way
out.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_DV" id="FNanchor_DV"></a><a href="#Footnote_DV" class="fnanchor">[DV]</a> Other insects employ different contrivances for
escape, as we have already seen, and shall still further
exemplify.</p>

<p>It is the middle portion of the cocoon, after removing the
floss or loose silk on the exterior, which is used in our
manufactures; and the first preparation is to throw the cocoons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
into warm water, and to stir them about with twigs, to
dissolve any slight gummy adhesions which may have occurred
when the caterpillar was spinning. The threads of
several cones, according to the strength of the silk wanted,
are then taken and wound off upon a reel. The refuse, consisting
of what we may call the tops and bottoms of the
cones, are not wound, but carded, like wool or cotton, in
order to form coarser fabrics. We learn from the fact of
the cocoons being generally unwound without breaking the
thread, that the insect spins the whole without interruption.
It is popularly supposed, however, that if it be disturbed
during the operation by any sort of noise, it will take alarm,
and break its thread; but Latreille says this is a vulgar
error.<a name="FNanchor_DW" id="FNanchor_DW"></a><a href="#Footnote_DW" class="fnanchor">[DW]</a></p>

<p>The length of the unbroken thread in a cocoon varies from
six hundred to a thousand feet; and as it is all spun double
by the insect, it will amount to nearly two thousand feet of
silk, the whole of which does not weigh above three grains
and a half; five pounds of silk from ten thousand cocoons is
considerably above the usual average. When we consider,
therefore, the enormous quantity of silk which is used at
present, the number of worms employed in producing it will
almost exceed our comprehension. The manufacture of the
silk, indeed, gives employment, and furnishes subsistence, to
several millions of human beings; and we may venture to
say, that there is scarcely an individual in the civilized world
who has not some article made of silk in his possession.</p>

<p>In ancient times, the manufacture of silk was confined to
the East Indies and China, where the insects that produce it
are indigenous. It was thence brought to Europe in small
quantities, and in early times sold at so extravagant a price,
that it was deemed too expensive even for royalty. The
Emperor Aurelian assigned the expense as a reason for
refusing his empress a robe of silk; and our own James I.,
before his accession to the crown of England, had to borrow
of the Earl of Mar a pair of silk stockings to appear in before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
the English ambassador, a circumstance which probably led
him to promote the cultivation of silk in England.<a name="FNanchor_DX" id="FNanchor_DX"></a><a href="#Footnote_DX" class="fnanchor">[DX]</a> The
Roman authors were altogether ignorant of its origin,&mdash;some
supposing it to be grown on trees as hair grows on animals,&mdash;others
that it was produced by a shell-fish similar to the
mussel, which is known to throw out threads for the purpose
of attaching itself to rocks,&mdash;others that it was the entrails of
a sort of spider, which was fed for four years with paste, and
then with the leaves of the green willow, till it burst with
fat,&mdash;and others that it was the produce of a worm which
built nests of clay and collected wax. The insect was at
length spread into Persia; and eggs were afterwards, at the
instance of the Emperor Justinian, concealed in hollow canes
by two monks, and conveyed to the Isle of Cos. This
emperor, in the sixth century, caused them to be introduced
into Constantinople, and made an object of public utility.
They were thence successively cultivated in Greece, in
Arabia, in Spain, in Italy, in France, and in all places where
any hope could be indulged of their succeeding. In America
the culture of the silk-worm was introduced into Virginia in
the time of James I., who himself composed a book of instructions
on the subject, and caused mulberry-trees and silk-worms&rsquo;
eggs to be sent to the colony. In Georgia, also,
lands were granted on condition of planting one hundred
white mulberry-trees on every ten acres of cleared land.<a name="FNanchor_DY" id="FNanchor_DY"></a><a href="#Footnote_DY" class="fnanchor">[DY]</a></p>

<p>The growth of the silk-worm has also been tried, but with
no great success, in this country. Evelyn computed that
one mulberry-tree would feed as many silk-worms annually
as would produce seven pounds of silk. &ldquo;According to that
estimate,&rdquo; says Barham,<a name="FNanchor_DZ" id="FNanchor_DZ"></a><a href="#Footnote_DZ" class="fnanchor">[DZ]</a> &ldquo;the two thousand trees already
planted in Chelsea Park (which take up one-third of it) will
make 14,000 lbs. weight of silk; to be commonly worth but
twenty shillings a pound, those trees must make 14,000<i>l.</i> per
annum.&rdquo; During the last century, some French refugees in
the south of Ireland made considerable plantations of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
mulberry, and had begun the cultivation of silk with every
appearance of success; but since their removal the trees have
been cut down.<a name="FNanchor_EA" id="FNanchor_EA"></a><a href="#Footnote_EA" class="fnanchor">[EA]</a> In the vicinity of London, also, a considerable
plantation of mulberry-trees was purchased by the
British, Irish, and Colonial Silk Company in 1825; but we
have not learned whether this Company have any active
measures now in operation.</p>

<p>The manufacture of silk was introduced into this country
in 1718, at Derby, by Mr. John Lombe, who travelled into
Italy to obtain the requisite information; but so jealous were
the Italians of this, that according to some statements which
have obtained belief, he fell a victim to their revenge, having
been poisoned at the early age of twenty-nine.<a name="FNanchor_EB" id="FNanchor_EB"></a><a href="#Footnote_EB" class="fnanchor">[EB]</a></p>

<p>There are not only several varieties of the common silk-worm
(<i>Bombyx mori</i>), but other species of caterpillars, which
spin silk capable of being manufactured, though not of so
good qualities as the common silk. None of our European
insects, however, seem to be well fitted for the purpose,
though it has been proposed by Fabricius and others to try
the crimson under-wing (<i>Catocala sponsa</i>, <span class="smcap">Schrank</span>), &amp;c. M.
Latreille quotes from the &lsquo;Recreations of Natural History,&rsquo;
by Wilhelm, the statement that the cocoons of the emperor-moth
(<i>Saturnia pavonia</i>) had been successfully tried in
Germany, by M. Wentzel Hegeer de Berchtoldsdorf, under
an imperial patent.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Cocoons of the Emperor-moth, cut open to show their structure.</span>
</div>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Emperor-Moth.</p>

<p>The emperor-moth, indeed, is no less worthy of our attention
with respect to the ingenuity of its architecture than
the beauty of its colours, and has consequently attracted the
attention of every Entomologist. The caterpillar feeds on
fruit-trees and on the willow, and spins a cocoon, in the form
of a Florence flask, of strong silk, so thickly woven that it
appears almost like damask or leather. It differs from most
other cocoons in not being closed at the upper or smaller
end, which terminates in a narrow circular aperture, formed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
by the convergence of little bundles of silk, gummed together,
and almost as elastic as whalebone. In consequence of all
these terminating in needle-shaped points, the entrance of
depredators is guarded against, upon the principle which
prevents the escape of a mouse from a wire trap. The insect,
however, not contented with this protection, constructs another
in form of a canopy or dome, within the external aperture,
so as effectually to shield the chrysalis from danger.
We have formerly remarked (page 210) that the caterpillar
of the <i>Ægeria asiliformis</i> of Stephens in a similar way did
not appear to be contented with a covering of thin wood,
without an additional bonnet of brown wax. The cocoon of
the emperor-moth, though thus in some measure impenetrable
from without, is readily opened from within; and when the
moth issues from its pupa case, it easily makes its way out
without either the acid or eye-files ascribed to the silk-worm.
The elastic silk gives way upon being pushed from within,
and when the insect is fairly out, it shuts again of its own
accord, like a door with spring hinges,&mdash;a circumstance
which at first puzzled Roesel not a little when he saw a fine
large moth in his box, and the cocoon apparently in the same
state as when he had put it there. Another naturalist conjectures
that the converging threads are intended to compress
the body of the moth as it emerges, in order to force the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
fluids into the nervures of the wings; for when he took the
chrysalis previously out of the cocoon, the wings of the moth
never expanded properly.<a name="FNanchor_EC" id="FNanchor_EC"></a><a href="#Footnote_EC" class="fnanchor">[EC]</a> Had he been much conversant
with breeding insects, he would rather, we think, have imputed
this to some injury which the chrysalis had received. We
have witnessed the shrivelling of the wings which he alludes
to, in many instances, and not unfrequently in butterflies
which spin no cocoon. The shrivelling, indeed, frequently
arises from the want of a sufficient supply of food to the
caterpillar in its last stage, occasioning a deficiency in the
fluids.</p>

<p>The elasticity of the cocoon is not peculiar to the emperor-moth.
A much smaller insect, the green cream-border-moth
(<i>Tortrix chlorana</i>) before mentioned (page 190), for its
ingenuity in bundling up the expanding leaves of the willow,
also spins an elastic shroud for its chrysalis, of the singular
shape of a boat with the keel uppermost. Like the caterpillar
of <i>Pyralis strigulalis</i> (page 217), whose building,
though of different materials, is exactly of the same form,
its first spins two approximating walls of whitish silk, of the
form required, and when these are completed, it draws them
forcibly together with elastic threads, so placed as to retain
them closely shut. The passage of the moth out of this
cocoon might have struck Roesel as still more marvellous
than that of his emperor, in which there was at least a small
opening; while in the boat cocoon there is none. We have
now before us two of these, which we watched the caterpillars
through the process of building, in the summer of 1828, and
from one only a moth issued&mdash;the other, as often happens,
having died in the chrysalis. But what is most remarkable,
it is impossible by the naked eye to tell which of these two
has been opened by the moth, so neatly has the joining been
finished. (J. R.)</p>

<p>Some species of moths spin a very slight silken tissue for
their cocoons, being apparently intended more to retain
them from falling than to afford protection from other accidents.
The gipsy-moth (<i>Hypogymna dispar</i>), rare in most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
parts of Britain, is one of these. It selects for its retreat a
crack in the bark of the tree upon which it feeds, and over
this spins only a few straggling threads. We found last
summer (1829), in the hole of an elm-tree in the Park at
Brussels, a group of half a dozen of these, that did not seem
to have spun any covering at all, but trusted to a curtain of
moss (<i>Hypna</i>) which margined the entrance. (J. R.) In a
species nearly allied to this, the yellow-tussock (<i>Dasychira
pudibunda</i>, <span class="smcap">Stephens</span>), the cocoon, one of which we have
now before us, is of a pretty close texture, and interwoven
with the long hairs of the caterpillar itself (see figure <i>b</i>, <a href="#Page_17">page
17</a>), which it plucks out piecemeal during the process of
building,&mdash;as is also done by the vapourer (<i>Orgyia antiqua</i>,
<span class="smcap">Hubner</span>), and many others.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Net-work cocoon.</span>
</div>

<p>These are additional instances of the remarks we formerly
made, that caterpillars which spin a slight web are transformed
into perfect insects in a much shorter period than
those which spin more substantial ones. Thus the cream-spot
tiger (<i>Arctia villica</i>, <span class="smcap">Stephens</span>) lies in chrysalis only
three weeks, and therefore does not require a strong web. It
is figured above, along with another, which is still slighter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
though more ingeniously woven, being regularly meshed like
net-work.</p>

<p>A very prettily-netted cocoon is constructed by the grub
of a very small grey weevil (<i>Hypera rumicis</i>), which is not
uncommon in July, on the seed spikes of docks (<i>Rumices</i>).
This cocoon is globular, and not larger than a garden pea,
though it appears to be very large in proportion to the pupa
of the insect, reminding us not a little of the carved ivory
balls from China. The meshes of the net-work are also
large, but the materials are strong and of a waxy consistence.
Upon remarking that no netting was ever spun over the part
of the plant to which the cocoon was attached, we endeavoured
to make them spin cocoons perfectly globular by detaching
them when nearly finished; but though we tried four or
five in this way, we could not make them add a single mesh
after removal, all of them making their escape through the
opening, and refusing to re-enter in order to complete their
structure. (J. R.)</p>

<p>The silk, if it may be so termed, spun by many species of
larvæ is of a still stronger texture than the waxy silk of the
little weevil just mentioned. We recently met with a remarkable
instance of this at Lee, in the cocoons of one of the
larger ichneumons (<i>Ophion Vinulæ</i>? <span class="smcap">Stephens</span>), inclosed in
that of a puss-moth (<i>Cerura Vinula</i>)&mdash;itself remarkable for
being composed of sand as well as wood, the fibres of which
had been scooped out of the underground cross-bar of an old
paling, to which it was attached. But the most singular portion
of this was the junction of the outer wall with the edges
of the hollow thus scooped out, which was formed of fibres of
wood placed across the fibres of the bar nearly at right angles,
and strongly cemented together, as if to form a secure foundation
for the building.</p>

<p>In this nest were formed, surreptitiously introduced into
the original building, five empty cells of a black colour,
about an inch long, and a sixth of an inch in diameter;
nearly cylindrical in form, but somewhat flattened; vertical
and parallel to one another, though slightly curved on the
inner side. The cells are composed of strong and somewhat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
coarse fibres, more like the carbonized rootlets of a tree than
silk, and resembling in texture a piece of coarse milled cloth
or felt, such as is used for the bases of plated hats. It is
worthy of remark, that all these cells opened towards one
end, as if the caterpillars which constructed them had been
aware that the wall of the puss-moth, in which the flies
would have to make a breach, was very hard, and would
require their united efforts to effect an escape. The importance
of such a precaution will appear more strikingly, when
we compare it with the instance formerly mentioned (page
215), in which only one ichneumon had been able to force
its way out. (J. R.)</p>

</div>

<p>It appears indispensable to some grubs to be confined
within a certain space in order to construct their cocoons.
We saw this well exemplified in the instance of a grub of
one of the mason-bees (<i>Osmia bicornis</i>), which we took from its
nest, and put into a box with the pollen paste which the
mother bee had provided for its subsistence. (See pages <a href="#Page_45">45</a>,
<a href="#Page_46">46</a>.) When it had completed its growth, it began to spin,
but in a very awkward manner-attaching threads, as if at
random, to the bits of pollen which remained undevoured,
and afterwards tumbling about to another part of the box, as
if dissatisfied with what it had done. It sometimes persevered
to spin in one place till it had formed a little vaulted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
wall; but it abandoned at the least three or four of these in
order to begin others, till at length, as if compelled by the
extreme urgency of the stimulus of its approaching change,
it completed a shell of shining brown silk, woven into a close
texture. Had the grub remained within the narrow clay cell
built for it by the mother bee, it would, in all probability,
not have thus exhausted itself in vain efforts at building,
which were likely to prevent it from ever arriving at the perfect
state&mdash;a circumstance which often happens in the artificial
breeding of insects. This bee, however, made its
appearance the following spring. (J. R.)</p>

<p>Besides silk, the cocoons of many insects are composed of
other animal secretions, intended to strengthen or otherwise
perfect their texture. We have already seen that some caterpillars
pluck off their own hair to interweave amongst their
silk; there are others which produce a peculiar substance for
the same purpose. The lackey caterpillar (<i>Clisiocampa
neustria</i>, <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>) in this manner lines its cocoon with pellets
of a downy substance, resembling little tufts of the flowers of
sulphur. The small egger, again (<i>Eriogaster lanestris</i>, <span class="smcap">Germar</span>),
can scarcely be said to employ silk at all,&mdash;the cocoon
being of a uniform texture, looking, at first sight, like dingy
Paris plaster, or the shell of a pheasant&rsquo;s egg; but upon being
broken, and inspected narrowly, a few threads of silk may be
seen interspersed through the whole. In size it is not larger
than the egg of the gold-crested wren. It has been considered
by Brahm a puzzling circumstance, that this cocoon
is usually perforated with one or two little holes, as if made
by a pin from without; and Kirby and Spence tell us that
their use has not been ascertained.<a name="FNanchor_ED" id="FNanchor_ED"></a><a href="#Footnote_ED" class="fnanchor">[ED]</a> May they not be left as
air-holes for the included chrysalis, as the close texture of the
cocoon might, without this provision, prove fatal to the animal?
Yet, on comparing one of these with a similar cocoon
of the large egger-moth (<i>Lasiocampa quercus</i>), we find no air-holes
in the latter, as we might have been led to expect from
the closeness of its texture. We found a cocoon of a saw-fly
(<i>Trichiosoma</i>), about the same size as that of the egger,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
attached to a hawthorn-twig, in a hedge at New Cross,
Deptford, but of a leathery texture, and, externally, exactly
the colour of the bark of the tree. During the summer of
1830 we found a considerable number of the same cocoons.
These were all without air-holes. The egger, we may remark,
unlike the dock-weevil or the bee-grub just mentioned,
can work her cocoon without any point of attachment. We
had a colony of these caterpillars in the summer of 1825,
brought from Epping Forest, and saw several of them work
their cocoons, and we could not but admire the dexterity
with which they avoided filling up the little pin-holes. The
supply of their building material was evidently measured out
to them in the exact quantity required; for when we broke
down a portion of their wall, by way of experiment, they did
not make it above half the thickness of the previous portion,
though they plainly preferred having a thin wall to leaving
the breach unclosed. (J. R.)</p>

<p>Several species of caterpillars, that spin only silk, are
social, like some of those we formerly mentioned, which unite
to form a common tent of leaves (see pages <a href="#Page_351">351</a>, <a href="#Page_352">352</a>, &amp;c.). The
most common instance of this is in the caterpillars which
feed on the nettle&mdash;the small tortoise-shell (<i>Vanessa urticæ</i>),
and the peacock&rsquo;s eye (<i>V. I.</i>). Colonies of these may be seen,
after midsummer, on almost every clump of nettles, inhabiting
a thin web of an irregular oval shape, from which they
issue out to feed on the leaves, always returning when their
appetite is satisfied, to assist their companions in extending
their premises. Other examples, still more conspicuous from
being seen on fruit-trees and in hedges, occur in the caterpillars
of the small ermine-moth (<i>Yponomeuta padella</i>), and
of the lackey (<i>Clisiocampa neustria</i>), which in some years are
but too abundant, though in others they are seldom met with.
In the summer of 1826, every hedge and fruit-tree around
London swarmed with colonies of the ermine, though it
has not since been plentiful; and in the same way, during
the summer of 1829, the lackeys were to be seen everywhere.
We mention this irregularity of appearance that our readers
may not disappoint themselves by looking for what is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
always to be found. It is probable that in 1830 the lackeys
will be few, for, notwithstanding the myriads of caterpillars
last summer, we saw only a single moth of this species, and
out of a number of chrysalides which a young friend had in
his nurse-boxes, not one moth was bred.</p>

<p>The small ermine does not, besides, feed so indiscriminately
as many others, but when the bird-cherry (<i>Prunus
padus</i>), its peculiar food, is not to be had, it will put up
with blackthorn, plum-tree, hawthorn, and almost any sort
of orchard fruit-tree. With respect to such caterpillars as
feed on different plants, Réaumur and De Geer make the
singular remark, that in most cases they would only eat the
sort of plant upon which they were originally hatched.<a name="FNanchor_EE" id="FNanchor_EE"></a><a href="#Footnote_EE" class="fnanchor">[EE]</a>
We verified this, in the case of the caterpillar in question,
upon two different nests which we took, in 1806, from the
bird-cherry at Crawfordland, in Ayrshire. Upon bringing
these to Kilmarnock, we could not readily supply them with
the leaves of this tree; and having then only a slight
acquaintance with the habits of insects, and imagining they
would eat any sort of leaf, we tried them with almost everything
green in the vicinity of the town; but they refused to
touch any which we offered them. After they had fasted
several days, we at length procured some fresh branches of
the bird-cherry, with which they gorged themselves so that
most of them died. Last summer (1829) we again tried a
colony of these caterpillars, found on a seedling plum-tree at
Lee, in Kent, with blackthorn, hawthorn, and many other
leaves, and even with those of the bird-cherry; but they
would touch nothing except the seedling plum, refusing the
grafted varieties. (J. R.)</p>

<p>A circumstance not a little remarkable in so very nice a
feeder is, that in some cases the mother moth will deposit
her eggs upon trees not of indigenous growth, and not even
of the same genus with her usual favourites. Thus, in
1825, the cherry-apple, or Siberian crab (<i>Pyrus prunifolia</i>,
<span class="smcap">Willdenow</span>), so commonly grown in the suburbs of London,
swarmed with them. On a single tree at Islington we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
counted above twenty nests, each of which would contain
from fifty to a hundred caterpillars; and though these do
not grow thicker than a crow-quill, so many of them scarcely
left a leaf undevoured, and, of course, the fruit, which
showed abundantly in spring, never came to maturity. The
summer following they were still more abundant on the
hawthorn hedges, particularly near the Thames, by Battersea
and Richmond. Since then we have only seen them
sparingly; and last summer we could only find the single
nest upon which we tried the preceding experiment. (J. R.)</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Encampment of the caterpillar of the small ermine (<i>Yponomeuta padella</i>) on the Siberian crab.</span>
</div>

<p>The caterpillars of other moths, which are in some years
very common&mdash;such as the brown-tail (<i>Porthesia auriflua</i>),
and the golden-tail (<i>P. chrysorrh&oelig;a</i>), are also social; and,
as the eggs are hatched late in the summer, the brood passes
the winter in a very closely-woven nest of warm silk. This
is usually represented as composed of leaves which have had
their pulpy parts eaten as food by the colonists; but from
minute observation of at least twenty of these nests in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
winter of 1828-9, we are quite satisfied that leaves are only
an accidental, and not a necessary, part of the structure.
When a leaf happens to be in the line of the walls of the
nest, it is included; but there is no apparent design in
pressing it into the service, nor is a branch selected because
it is leafy. On the contrary, by far the greater number of
these nests do not contain a single leaf, but are composed
entirely of grey silk. In external form, no two of these
nests are alike; as it depends entirely upon the form of the
branch. When, therefore, there is only one twig, it is somewhat
egg-shaped; but when there are several twigs, it
commonly joins each, assuming an angular shape, as may be
seen in the left-hand figure.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 364px;">

<span class="fig_caption">Winter nests of <i>Porthesia chrysorrh&oelig;a</i>, one being cut open to show the chambers.
The dots represent the egesta of the caterpillars.</span>
</div>

<p>This irregularity arises from the circumstance of each
individual acting on its own account, without the direction
or superintendence of the others. The interior of the
structure is, for the same reason, more regular, being divided
into compartments, each of which forms a chamber for one
or more individuals. Previous to the cold weather, these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
chambers have but slight partitions; but before the frosts
set in the whole is made thick and warm.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Winter nest of the Social Caterpillars of the Brown-tail Moth (<i>Porthesia auriflua</i>),

</div>

<p>None of the preceding details, however, appear so striking
as what is recorded of the brown-tail moth (<i>Porthesia auriflua</i>)
by Mr. W. Curtis,<a name="FNanchor_EF" id="FNanchor_EF"></a><a href="#Footnote_EF" class="fnanchor">[EF]</a> whose multitudinous colonies
spread great alarm over the country in the summer of 1782.
This alarm was much increased by the exaggeration and
ignorant details which found their way into the newspapers.
The actual numbers of these caterpillars must have been
immense, since Curtis says, &ldquo;in many of the parishes near
London subscriptions have been opened, and the poor people
employed to cut off the webs at one shilling per bushel,
which have been burnt under the inspection of the church-wardens,
overseers, or beadle of the parish: at the first
onset of this business fourscore bushels, as I was most
credibly informed, were collected in one day in the parish of
Clapham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is not, therefore, very much to be wondered at, that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
ignorant, who are so prone to become the victims of groundless
fears, should have taken serious alarm on having so
unusual a phenomenon forced upon their attention. Some
alarmists accordingly asserted that the caterpillars &ldquo;were
the usual presage of the plague;&rdquo; and others that they not
only presaged it, but would actually cause it, for &ldquo;their
numbers were great enough to render the air pestilential;&rdquo;
while, to add to the mischief, &ldquo;they would destroy every
kind of vegetation, and starve the cattle in the fields.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Almost every one,&rdquo; adds Curtis, &ldquo;ignorant of their history,
was under the greatest apprehensions concerning them; so
that even prayers were offered up in some churches to
deliver the country from the apprehended approaching
calamity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seems to have been either the same caterpillar, or one
very nearly allied to it, probably that of the golden-tail
(<i>Porthesia chrysorrh&oelig;a</i>), which in 1731-2 produced a similar
alarm in France. Réaumur, on going from Paris to Tours,
in September, 1730, found every oak, great and small,
literally swarming with them, and their leaves parched and
brown as if some burning wind had passed over them; for
when newly hatched, like the young buff-tips, they only eat
one of the membranes of the leaf, and of course the other
withers away. These infant legions, under the shelter of
their warm nests, survived the winter in such numbers, that
they threatened the destruction not only of the fruit-trees,
but of the forests,&mdash;every tree, as Réaumur says, being overrun
with them. The Parliament of Paris thought that
ravages so widely extended loudly called for their interference,
and they accordingly issued an edict, to compel
the people to uncaterpillar (<i>décheniller</i>) the trees; which
Réaumur ridiculed as impracticable, at least in the forests.
About the middle of May, however, a succession of cold
rains produced so much mortality among the caterpillars,
that the people were happily released from the edict; for it
soon became difficult to find a single individual of the
species.<a name="FNanchor_EG" id="FNanchor_EG"></a><a href="#Footnote_EG" class="fnanchor">[EG]</a> In the same way the cold rains, during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
summer of 1829, seem to have nearly annihilated the lackeys,
which in the early part of the summer swarmed on every
hedge around London. The ignorance displayed in France,
at the time in question, was not inferior to that recorded by
Curtis; for the French journalists gravely asserted that part
of the caterpillars were produced by spiders; and that these
spiders, and not the caterpillars, constructed the webs of the
slime of snails, which they were said to have been seen
collecting for the purpose! &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; exclaims Réaumur,
&ldquo;there is more ignorance in our age than one might
believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is justly remarked by Curtis, that the caterpillar of the
brown-tail moth is not so limited a feeder as some, nor so
indiscriminate as others; but that it always confines itself
to trees or shrubs, and is never found on herbaceous plants,
whose low growth would seldom supply a suitable foundation
for its web. Hence the absurdity of supposing it
would attack the herbage of the field, and produce a famine
among cattle. Curtis says, it is found on the &ldquo;hawthorn
most plentifully, oak the same, elm very plentifully, most
fruit-trees the same, blackthorn plentifully, rose-trees the
same, bramble the same, on the willow and poplar scarce.
None have been noticed on the elder, walnut, ash, fir, or
herbaceous plants. With respect to fruit-trees the injuries
they sustain are most serious, as, in destroying the blossoms
as yet in the bud, they also destroy the fruit in embryo;
the owners of orchards, therefore, have great reason to be
alarmed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sudden appearance of great numbers of these caterpillars
in particular years, and their scarcity in others, is
in some degree explained by a fact stated by Mr. Salisbury.
&ldquo;A gentleman of Chelsea,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;has informed me that
he once took a nest of moths and bred them; that some of
the eggs came the first year, some the second, and others of
the same nest did not hatch till the third season.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_EH" id="FNanchor_EH"></a><a href="#Footnote_EH" class="fnanchor">[EH]</a> We
reared, during 1829, several nests both of the brown-tails
and of the golden-tails, and a number of the females
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
deposited their eggs in our nurse-cages; but, contrary to the
experiment just quoted, all of these were hatched during
the same autumn. (J. R.) The difference of temperature
and moisture in particular seasons may produce this
diversity.</p>

<p>A no less remarkable winter nest, of a small species of
social caterpillar, is described by M. Bonnet, which we
omitted to introduce when treating of the Glanville fritillary.
The nest in question is literally pendulous, being hung
from the branch of a fruit tree by a strong silken thread.
It consists of one or two leaves neatly folded, and held
together with silk, in which the caterpillars live harmoniously
together.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 340px;">
<img src="images/356.png" width="340" height="226" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Pendulous leaf-nests, from Bonnet.</span>
</div>

<p>In a recently-published volume of &lsquo;Travels in Mexico,&rsquo;
we find a very remarkable account of some pendulous nests
of caterpillars, which appear to be almost as curious as the
nests of the pasteboard-making wasps, described at <a href="#Page_177">p. 177</a>.
The author of these Travels does not define the species of
caterpillar whose constructions attracted his observation.
He says, "After having ascended for about an hour, we
came to the region of oaks and other majestically tall trees,
the names of which I could not learn. Suspended from
their stately branches were innumerable nests, enclosed,
apparently, in white paper bags, in the manner of bunches
of grapes in England, to preserve them from birds and flies.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
I had the curiosity to examine one of them, which I found
to contain numberless caterpillars. The texture is so strong
that it is not easily torn; and the interior contained a
quantity of green leaves, to support the numerous progeny
within."<a name="FNanchor_EI" id="FNanchor_EI"></a><a href="#Footnote_EI" class="fnanchor">[EI]</a></p>

<p>[We will now give a brief account of several foreign insects
that are remarkable for the pendulous nests which they
make.</p>

<p>The first of these is built by a hymenopterous insect belonging
to the genus Larrada. It is fastened to the under side of a
leaf, and is made of vegetable fibres, cut up very short, and
masticated by the insect, much like the materials used by
the Fungus Ant, described on page 311. The insect which
forms this nest is black in colour and has very thick legs.
The wings are clouded. It is but a small insect, being only
three-eighths of an inch in length. Both nest and insect are
in the collection of Mr. F. Smith, of the British Museum.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 245px;">
<img src="images/357.png" width="245" height="251" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Nest of Larrada.</span>
</div>

<p>In the next illustration are seen two nests built by hymenopterous
insects belonging to the hymenopterous genus
Polybia. The left-hand figure represents a nest made by
Polybia sedula, a Brazilian insect. It is fixed to a large
leaf, and, as may be seen, has the entrance at the end of a
long neck. The exterior of the nest is a very thin sheet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
of pale-brown substance, almost identical with the paper
with which our British wasps make their nests. It is,
however, very much stronger and very much thinner, and
is very close in texture, so that it effectually excludes rain.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 505px;">
<img src="images/358.png" width="505" height="437" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Nests of Polybia.</span>
</div>

<p>The right-hand figure shows a nest also brought from
Brazil. It has no neck, the opening being a mere hole
beneath. The name Polybia is derived from two Greek
words signifying that many insects live together, and has
been given to the genus on account of the social habits of
its members.</p>

<p>Our next illustration contains some very remarkable
nests.</p>

<p>The large central nest is the cocoon of a moth belonging
to the genus Oiketicus, or Housebuilder. There
are many species of Housebuilder moths, and all are remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
for the fact that the larva never exhibits itself,
but builds a dwelling in which it conceals itself, just as does
the well-known caddis-worm. Indeed the nests of several
Oiketici look exactly as if the dwelling of a caddis-worm
had been greatly enlarged and hung up in a tree.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 497px;">
<img src="images/359.png" width="497" height="445" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Nests of Oiketicus, &amp;c.</span>
</div>

<p>The nest of this species, however, differs from that of the
common Oiketicus by being covered with a coating of greyish
silk. If we cut open the silk, we find a great number of
little sticks and leaf-stems crossed on each other, and
showing their ends through the silken cover. Within these
defences there is a layer of leaves cut into small pieces, and
lastly comes the cell inhabited by the caterpillar. It is
lined with a silken web similar in character to that on the
outside, but finer, stronger, and whiter The caterpillar is
therefore defended by four distinct barriers. First comes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
the strong silken web which lines the cell, and next is the
layer of leaf fragments. Outside them comes the <i>chevaux
de frise</i> of crossed sticks, and lastly we have the grey silken
web. This outer wrapper has no connection with the
interior of the cell, and is only lightly attached to the
ends of the cross sticks.</p>

<p>Within this curious dwelling the caterpillar conceals the
whole of its body, clinging to the branch or leaf by its feet,
and if alarmed drawing itself up so that the mouth of the
cocoon is pressed tightly against the branch, and effectually
conceals even the feet which hold it.</p>

<p>The other figure on the right hand represents the dwelling
of another Housebuilder caterpillar. It looks very much as if
it were made of drab cloth. The most remarkable point about
it is the lower end. When the insect is within the dwelling
the extremity has a spiral twist, but when the moth has
escaped the spiral form is destroyed, and it appears as represented
in the illustration. The female Oiketicus never attains
the winged state nor leaves her house, but lives and dies
in it, almost unchanged in shape. In fact, the adult female
is even more undeveloped in appearance than the caterpillar,
and looks like a large, fat, unwieldy grub, covered with down.
The male, on the contrary, is a tolerably active moth, with
sharply-pointed wings and beautiful feathered antennæ.</p>

<p>Another kind of Housebuilder&rsquo;s residence is shown in the
lower left-hand figure, enveloped and almost concealed by
leaves.</p>

<p>The remaining figures represent the dwellings of two
unknown insects, both from Australia. The upper left-hand
nest is made wonderfully like that of the weaver-bird,
being composed of fibres like cow-hairs woven loosely
together. It is brown outside and white in the interior.</p>

<p>The last nest is made of some substance which is smooth,
and hard as horn, brown within, and dark grey on the
outside. The circular lid by which the enclosed insect
escapes is shown open.</p>

<p>In the accompanying illustration, we have five remarkable
pensile nests of insects, some British, and others exotic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>Fig. 1 represents the nest of a Pelopæus from Natal. It is
made of dried cow-dung, and is fixed to straws. The length
is from three to five inches, and there are sometimes found
three or more in a row upon a single straw. The insect is
about an inch in length, black-blue in colour, and with
clouded wings. The abdomen is small, sharply pointed, and
placed on a long footstalk.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Nests of Pelopæus (1, 2); Anthidium (3); Trypoxylon (4); and Eumenes (5).</span>
</div>

<p>At Fig. 2 is seen the nest of <i>Pelopæus Flavipes</i>, a North
American insect, which is also fixed along its whole length to
the supporting object, which is sometimes a wall, and sometimes,
as in the illustration, a branch. It is made of mud,
and the insects seem to have a sort of gregarious instinct,
loving to fix their nests in rows, one above the other. There
is only one larva in each cell. The Pelopæi are, by the way,
allied to the English genus <i>Ammophila</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>Fig. 3 shows the nest of <i>Anthidium cordatum</i>, one of the
solitary bees of Natal. It is made of vegetable fibres. The
insect as well as the nest is represented of the natural size.
It is black and shining, with the under part and sides and
legs yellowish.</p>

<p>At Fig. 4 are seen three of the nests of <i>Trypoxylon aurifrons</i>,
a Brazilian insect. They are built of mud, and are
remarkable for their elegant shape, which looks as if it had
been formed by the hand of the potter, and for the manner
in which the mouth is turned over so as to form a distinct
neck. The larvæ is fed with a store of spiders. The insect
is represented of the natural size; its colour is black, and
the face is covered with short golden hairs, a fact which
has gained for it the name of aurifrons, or golden-fronted.</p>

<p>Our last example, Fig. 5, is the nest of an English insect,
<i>Eumenes coarctata</i>. The insect is represented of its natural size.
It is very pretty in colour as well as elegant in shape, being
black, diversified with yellow bands and spots. The nest is
made of clay, and is found upon the heath twigs. The larvæ
of the Eumenes are fed with those of a species of <i>Crambus</i>.
The insect is tolerably common in Surrey and Hampshire,
and appears in July and August.</p>

<p>The three figures in the next illustration represent the
cocoons of three species of the Bombycidæ, and are given in
order to show the different modes by which they are fastened.
The upper nest is hung by a slight cord, which spreads into a
broad silken band wrapped round the branch for some distance.
The right-hand figure shows a very remarkable
cocoon suspended by a long footstalk affixed to a ring.
The remarkable point in the construction of this ring is
that it is very hard and horny, and is not fastened to the
branch, but passes loosely round it, so that the cocoon swings
backwards and forwards in the breeze. The cocoon is about
two inches in length, and is covered with thick black veinings.
The lowermost cocoon is most curiously fixed to the branch
by bending the leaves round the exterior of the dwelling, and
fixing them to it with silk. All these specimens were
brought from Northern India.]</p>

<p>In all the nests of social caterpillars, care is taken to
leave apertures for passing out and in. It is remarkable,
also, that however far they may ramble from their nest,
they never fail to find their way back when a shower of
rain or nightfall renders shelter necessary. It requires no
great shrewdness to discover how they effect this: for by
looking closely at their track it will be found that it is
carpeted with silk&mdash;no individual moving an inch without
constructing such a pathway, both for the use of his companions
and to facilitate his own return. All these social
caterpillars, therefore, move more or less in processional
order, each following the road which the first chance traveller
has marked out with his strip of silk carpeting.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Nest and order of marching of the Processionary Caterpillars of the oak (<i>Cnethocampa processionea</i>).</span>
</div>

<p>There are some species, however, which are more remarkable
than others in the regularity of their processional
marchings, particularly two which are found in the south
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
of Europe, but are not indigenous in Britain. The one
named by Réaumur the Processionary (<i>Cnethocampa processionea</i>,
<span class="smcap">Stephens</span>) feeds upon the oak; a brood dividing,
when newly hatched, into one or more parties of several
hundred individuals, which afterwards unite in constructing a
common nest nearly two feet long, and from four to six
inches in diameter. As it is not divided like that of the
brown-tails into chambers, but consists of one large hall, it is
not necessary that there should be more openings than one;
and accordingly, when an individual goes out and carpets a
path, the whole colony instinctively follow in the same track,
though from the immense population they are often compelled
to march in parallel files from two to six deep. The
procession is always headed by a single caterpillar; sometimes
the leader is immediately followed by one or two in
single file, and sometimes by two abreast, as represented in
the cut. A similar procedure is followed by a species of
social caterpillars which feed on the pine in Savoy and
Languedoc; and though their nests are not half the size of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
the preceding, they are more worthy of notice, from the
strong and excellent quality of their silk, which Réaumur was
of opinion might be advantageously manufactured. Their
nest consists of more chambers than one, but is furnished
with a main entrance, through which the colonists conduct
their foraging processions.</p>

<p>[In the accompanying illustration is shown a nest of the
Processionary caterpillar, part of which has been torn away
to show the interior. Inside may be seen the larva of a certain
beetle (<i>Calosoma sycophanta</i>), which feeds on these caterpillars,
and one of the beetles is seen below in the act of ascending
the tree. This beetle, although exceedingly scarce in England,
is very common on the Continent, and trees have been cleared
of Processionary caterpillars by the simple process of putting
a few female beetles upon the branches.]</p>

<p class="caption2">STRUCTURES OF SPIDERS.</p>


<p>Modern naturalists do not rank spiders among insects,
because they have no antennæ, and no division between
the head and the shoulders. They breathe by leaf-shaped gills,
situated under the belly, instead of spiracles in the sides;
have a heart connected with these; have eight legs instead
of six; and eight fixed eyes. But as spiders are popularly
considered insects, it will sufficiently suit our purpose to
introduce them here as such.</p>

<p>The apparatus by which spiders construct their ingenious
fabrics is much more complicated than that which we have
described as common to the various species of caterpillars.
Caterpillars have only two reservoirs for the materials of
their silk; but spiders, according to the dissections of
M. Treviranus, have four principal vessels, two larger and
two smaller, with a number of minute ones at their base.
Several small tubes branch towards the reservoirs, for carrying
to them, no doubt, a supply of the secreted material.
Swammerdam describes them as twisted into many coils of
an agate colour.<a name="FNanchor_EJ" id="FNanchor_EJ"></a><a href="#Footnote_EJ" class="fnanchor">[EJ]</a> We do not find them coiled, but nearly
straight, and of a deep-yellow colour. From these, when
broken, threads can be drawn out like those spun by the
spider, though we cannot draw them so fine by many degrees.</p>

<p>From these little flasks or bags of gum, situated near the
apex of the abdomen, and not at the mouth, as in caterpillars,
a tube originates, and terminates in the external spinnerets,
which may be seen by the naked eye in the larger spiders, in
the form of five little teats surrounded by a circle, as represented
in the following figure.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 326px;">
<img src="images/367.png" width="326" height="372" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Garden Spider (<i>Epeira diadema</i>), suspended by a thread proceeding from its spinneret.</span>
</div>

<p>We have seen that the silken thread of a caterpillar is composed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
of two united within the tube of the spinneret, but the
spider&rsquo;s thread would appear, from the first view of its five
spinnerets, to be quintuple, and in some species which have
six teats, so many times more. It is not safe, however, in
our interpretations of nature to proceed upon conjecture,
however plausible, nor to take anything for granted which we
have not actually seen; since our inferences in such cases
are almost certain to be erroneous. If Aristotle, for example,
had ever looked narrowly at a spider when spinning, he could
not have fancied, as he does, that the materials which it uses
are nothing but wool stripped from its body. On looking,
then, with a strong magnifying glass, at the teat-shaped
spinnerets of a spider, we perceive them studded with regular
rows of minute bristle-like points, about a thousand to each
teat, making in all from five to six thousand. These are
minute tubes which we may appropriately term <i>spinnerules</i>,
as each is connected with the internal reservoirs, and emits a
thread of inconceivable fineness. In the following figure, this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
wonderful apparatus is represented as it appears in the
microscope.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 247px;">
<img src="images/368.png" width="247" height="246" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Spinnerets of a Spider magnified to show the <i>Spinnerules</i>.</span>
</div>

<p>We do not recollect that naturalists have ventured to assign
any cause for this very remarkable multiplicity of the
spinnerules of spiders, so different from the simple spinneret
of caterpillars. To us it appears to be an admirable provision
for their mode of life. Caterpillars neither require such
strong materials, nor that their thread should dry as quickly.
It is well known in our manufactures, particularly in rope-spinning,
that in cords of equal thickness, those which are
composed of many smaller ones united are greatly stronger
than those which are spun at once. In the instance of the
spider&rsquo;s thread, this principle must hold still more strikingly,
inasmuch as it is composed of fluid materials that require to
be dried rapidly, and this drying must be greatly facilitated
by exposing so many to the air separately before their union,
which is effected at the distance of about a tenth of an inch
from the spinnerets. In the following figure each of the
threads represented is reckoned to contain one hundred
minute threads, the whole forming only one of the spider&rsquo;s
common threads.</p>

<p>Leeuwenhoeck, in one of his extraordinary microscopical
observations on a young spider not bigger than a grain of
sand, upon enumerating the threadlets in one of its threads,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
calculated that it would require four millions of them to be
as thick as a hair of his beard.</p>

</table>

<p>Another important advantage derived by the spider from
the multiplicity of its threadlets is, that the thread affords a
much more secure attachment to a wall, a branch of a tree,
or any other object, than if it were simple; for, upon pressing
the spinneret against the object, as spiders always do when
they fix a thread, the spinnerules are extended over an area
of some diameter, from every hair&rsquo;s-breadth of which a <i>strand</i>,
as rope-makers term it, is extended to compound the main
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
cord. The preceding figure exhibits this ingenious contrivance.</p>

<p>Those who may be curious to examine this contrivance
will see it best when the line is attached to any black object,
for the threads, being whitish, are, in other cases, not so
easily perceived.</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Shooting of the Lines.</p>

<p>It has long been considered a curious though a difficult
investigation, to determine in what manner spiders, seeing
that they are destitute of wings, transport themselves from
tree to tree, across brooks, and frequently through the air
itself, without any apparent starting point. On looking into
the authors who have treated upon this subject, it is surprising
how little there is to be met with that is new, even in
the most recent. Their conclusions, or rather their conjectural
opinions, are, however, worthy of notice; for by unlearning
error, we the more firmly establish truth.</p>

<p>1.  One of the earliest notions upon this subject is that of
Blancanus, the commentator on Aristotle, which is partly
adopted by Redi, by Henricus Regius of Utrecht, by Swammerdam,<a name="FNanchor_EK" id="FNanchor_EK"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_EK" class="fnanchor">[EK]</a>
by Lehmann, and by Kirby and Spence.<a name="FNanchor_EL" id="FNanchor_EL"></a><a href="#Footnote_EL" class="fnanchor">[EL]</a> &ldquo;The
spider&rsquo;s thread,&rdquo; says Swammerdam, &ldquo;is generally made up
of two or more parts, and after descending by such a thread,
it ascends by one only, and is thus enabled to waft itself from
one height or tree to another, even across running waters;
the thread it leaves loose behind it being driven about by
the wind, and so fixed to some other body.&rdquo; &ldquo;I placed,&rdquo;
says Kirby, "the large garden spider (<i>Epeira diadema</i>) upon
a stick about a foot long, set upright in a vessel containing
water.&#8230; It let itself drop, not by a single thread,
but by <i>two</i>, each distant from the other about the twelfth of
an inch, guided, as usual, by one of its hind feet, and one
apparently smaller than the other. When it had suffered
itself to descend nearly to the surface of the water, it stopped
short, and by some means, which I could not distinctly see,
broke off, close to the spinners, the smallest thread, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
still adhering by the other end to the top of the stick, floated
in the air, and was so light as to be carried about by the
slightest breath. On approaching a pencil to the loose end
of this line, it did not adhere from mere contact. I therefore
twisted it once or twice round the pencil, and then drew it
tight. The spider, which had previously climbed to the top
of the stick, immediately pulled at it with one of its feet, and
finding it sufficiently tense, crept along it, strengthening it
as it proceeded by another thread, and thus reached the
pencil."</p>

<p>We have repeatedly witnessed this occurrence, both in
the fields and when spiders were placed for experiment, as
Kirby has described; but we very much doubt that the
thread broken is ever intended as a bridge cable, or that it
would have been so used in that instance, had it not been
artificially fixed and accidentally found again by the spider.
According to our observations, a spider never abandons, for
an instant, the thread which she despatches in quest of an
attachment, but uniformly keeps trying it with her feet, in
order to ascertain its success. We are, therefore, persuaded
that when a thread is broken in the manner above described,
it is because it has been spun too weak; and spiders may
often be seen breaking such threads in the process of netting
their webs. (J. R.)</p>

<p>The plan, besides, as explained by these distinguished
writers, would more frequently prove abortive than successful,
from the cut thread not being sufficiently long.
They admit, indeed, that spiders&rsquo; lines are often found &ldquo;a
yard or two long, fastened to twigs of grass not a foot in
height.&#8230; Here, therefore, some other process must
have been used.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_EM" id="FNanchor_EM"></a><a href="#Footnote_EM" class="fnanchor">[EM]</a></p>

<p>2.  Our celebrated English naturalist, Dr. Lister, whose
treatise upon our native spiders has been the basis of every
subsequent work on the subject, maintains that "some
spiders shoot out their threads in the same manner that
porcupines do their quills;<a name="FNanchor_EN" id="FNanchor_EN"></a><a href="#Footnote_EN" class="fnanchor">[EN]</a> that whereas the quills of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
latter are entirely separated from their bodies, when thus
shot out, the threads of the former remain fixed to their
anus, as the sun&rsquo;s rays to its body."<a name="FNanchor_EO" id="FNanchor_EO"></a><a href="#Footnote_EO" class="fnanchor">[EO]</a> A French periodical
writer goes a little farther, and says, that spiders have the
power of shooting out threads, and directing them at pleasure
towards a determined point, judging of the distance and
position of the object by some sense of which we are ignorant.<a name="FNanchor_EP" id="FNanchor_EP"></a><a href="#Footnote_EP" class="fnanchor">[EP]</a>
Kirby also says, that he once observed a small garden
spider (<i>Aranea reticulata</i>) &ldquo;standing midway on a long perpendicular
fixed thread, and an appearance caught&rdquo; his &ldquo;eye,
of what seemed to be the emission of threads.&rdquo; &ldquo;I, therefore,&rdquo;
he adds, &ldquo;moved my arm in the direction in which they
apparently proceeded, and, as I had suspected, a floating
thread attached itself to my coat, along which the spider
crept. As this was connected with the spinners of the spider,
it could not have been formed&rdquo; by breaking a &ldquo;secondary
thread.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_EQ" id="FNanchor_EQ"></a><a href="#Footnote_EQ" class="fnanchor">[EQ]</a> Again, in speaking of the gossamer-spider, he
says, &ldquo;it first extends its thigh, shank, and foot, into a right
line, and then, elevating its abdomen till it becomes vertical,
<i>shoots its thread</i> into the air, and flies off from its station.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_ER" id="FNanchor_ER"></a><a href="#Footnote_ER" class="fnanchor">[ER]</a></p>

<p>Another distinguished naturalist, Mr. White of Selborne,
in speaking of the gossamer-spider, says, &ldquo;Every day in fine
weather in autumn do I see these spiders shooting out their
webs, and mounting aloft: they will go off from the finger,
if you will take them into your hand. Last summer, one
alighted on my book as I was reading in the parlour; and
running to the top of the page, and <i>shooting out a web</i>, took
its departure from thence. But what I most wondered at
was, that it went off with considerable velocity in a place
where no air was stirring; and I am sure I did not assist it
with my breath.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_ES" id="FNanchor_ES"></a><a href="#Footnote_ES" class="fnanchor">[ES]</a></p>

<p>Having so often witnessed the thread set afloat in the air
by spiders, we can readily conceive the way in which those
eminent naturalists were led to suppose it to be ejected by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
some animal force acting like a syringe; but as the statement
can be completely disproved by experiment, we shall
only at present ask, in the words of Swammerdam&mdash;&ldquo;how
can it be possible that a thread so fine and slender should
be shot out with force enough to divide and pass through
the air?&mdash;is it not rather probable that the air would stop
its progress, and so entangle it and fit it to perplex the
spider&rsquo;s operations?&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_ET" id="FNanchor_ET"></a><a href="#Footnote_ET" class="fnanchor">[ET]</a> The opinion, indeed, is equally
improbable with another, suggested by Dr. Lister, that the
spider can retract her thread within the abdomen, after it
has been emitted.<a name="FNanchor_EU" id="FNanchor_EU"></a><a href="#Footnote_EU" class="fnanchor">[EU]</a> De Geer<a name="FNanchor_EV" id="FNanchor_EV"></a><a href="#Footnote_EV" class="fnanchor">[EV]</a> very justly joins Swammerdam
in rejecting both of these fancies, which, in our own
earlier observations upon spiders, certainly struck us as
plausible and true. There can be no doubt, indeed, that
the animal has a voluntary power of permitting the material
to escape, or stopping it at pleasure, but this power is not
projectile.</p>

<p>3. &ldquo;There are many people,&rdquo; says the Abbé de la Pluche,
&ldquo;who believe that the spider flies when they see her pass
from branch to branch, and even from one high tree to
another; but she transports herself in this manner: she
places herself upon the end of a branch, or some projecting
body, and there fastens her thread; after which, with her
two hind feet, she squeezes her dugs (<i>spinnerets</i>), and presses
out one or more threads of two or three ells in length, which
she leaves to float in the air till it be fixed to some particular
place.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_EW" id="FNanchor_EW"></a><a href="#Footnote_EW" class="fnanchor">[EW]</a> Without pretending to have observed this, Swammerdam
says, &ldquo;I can easily comprehend how spiders, without
giving themselves any motion, may, by only compressing
their spinnerets, force out a thread, which being driven by
the wind, may serve to waft them from one place to
another.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_EX" id="FNanchor_EX"></a><a href="#Footnote_EX" class="fnanchor">[EX]</a> Others, proceeding upon a similar notion, give a
rather different account of the matter. &ldquo;The spider,&rdquo; says
Bingley, "fixes one end of a thread to the place where she
stands, and then with her hind paws draws out several other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
threads from the nipples, which, being lengthened out and
driven by the wind to some neighbouring tree or other
object, are by their natural clamminess fixed to it."<a name="FNanchor_EY" id="FNanchor_EY"></a><a href="#Footnote_EY" class="fnanchor">[EY]</a></p>

<p>Observation gives some plausibility to the latter opinion,
as the spider always actively uses her legs, though not to
draw out the thread, but to ascertain whether it has caught
upon any object. The notion of her pressing the spinneret
with her feet must be a mere fancy; at least it is not countenanced
by anything which we have observed.</p>

<p>4.  An opinion much more recondite is mentioned, if it
was not started, by M. D&rsquo;Isjonval, that the floating of the
spider&rsquo;s thread is electrical. &ldquo;Frogs, cats, and other
animals,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;are affected by natural electricity, and
feel the change of weather; but no other animal more than
myself and my spiders.&rdquo; During wet and windy weather
he accordingly found that they spun very short lines, &ldquo;but
when a spider spins a long thread, there is a certainty of
fine weather for at least ten or twelve days afterwards.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_EZ" id="FNanchor_EZ"></a><a href="#Footnote_EZ" class="fnanchor">[EZ]</a> A
periodical writer, who signs himself Carolan,<a name="FNanchor_FA" id="FNanchor_FA"></a><a href="#Footnote_FA" class="fnanchor">[FA]</a> fancies that in
darting out her thread the spider emits a stream of air, or
some subtle electric fluid, by which she guides it as if by
magic.</p>

<p>A living writer (Mr. John Murray), whose learning and
skill in conducting experiments give no little weight to his
opinions, has carried these views considerably farther.
&ldquo;The aëronautic spider,&rdquo; he says, "can propel its thread
both horizontally and vertically, and at all relative angles,
in motionless air, and in an atmosphere agitated by winds;
nay more, the aërial traveller can even dart its thread, to
use a nautical phrase, in the &lsquo;wind&rsquo;s eye.&rsquo; My opinion
and observations are based on many hundred experiments.&#8230;
The entire phenomena are electrical. When a
thread is propelled in a vertical plane, it remains perpendicular
to the horizontal plane, always upright, and when
others are projected at angles more or less inclined, their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
direction is invariably preserved; the threads never intermingle,
and when a pencil of threads is propelled, it ever
presents the appearance of a divergent brush. These are
electrical phenomena, and cannot be explained but on
electrical principles."</p>

<p>&ldquo;In clear, fine weather, the air is invariably positive;
and it is precisely in such weather that the aëronautic
spider makes its ascent most easily and rapidly, whether
it be in summer or in winter.&rdquo; &ldquo;When the air is weakly
positive, the ascent of the spider will be difficult, and its
altitude extremely limited, and the threads propelled will
be but little elevated above the horizontal plane. When
negative electricity prevails, as in cloudy weather, or on
the approach of rain, and the index of De Saussure&rsquo;s hygrometer
rapidly advancing towards humidity, the spider is
unable to ascend.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_FB" id="FNanchor_FB"></a><a href="#Footnote_FB" class="fnanchor">[FB]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Murray had previously told us, that &ldquo;when a stick of
excited sealing-wax is brought near the thread of suspension,
it is evidently repelled; consequently, the electricity of the
thread is of a negative character,&rdquo; while &ldquo;an excited glass
tube brought near, seemed to attract the thread, and with it
the aëronautic spider.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_FC" id="FNanchor_FC"></a><a href="#Footnote_FC" class="fnanchor">[FC]</a> His friend, Mr. Bowman, further
describes the aërial spider as &ldquo;shooting out four or five,
often six or eight, extremely fine webs several yards long,
which waved in the breeze, diverging from each other like a
pencil of rays.&rdquo; One of them &ldquo;had two distinct and
widely-diverging fasciculi of webs,&rdquo; and &ldquo;a line uniting
them would have been at right angles to the direction of the
breeze.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_FD" id="FNanchor_FD"></a><a href="#Footnote_FD" class="fnanchor">[FD]</a></p>

<p>Such is the chief evidence in support of the electrical
theory; but though we have tried these experiments, we
have not succeeded in verifying any one of them. The
following statements of Mr. Blackwall come nearer our own
observations.</p>

<p>5.  &ldquo;Having procured a small branched twig,&rdquo; says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
Mr. Blackwall, "I fixed it upright in an earthen vessel
containing water, its base being immersed in the liquid,
and upon it I placed several of the spiders which produce
gossamer. Whenever the insects thus circumstanced were
exposed to a current of air, either naturally or artificially
produced, they directly turned the thorax towards the
quarter whence it came, even when it was so slight as
scarcely to be perceptible, and elevating the abdomen, they
emitted from their spinners a small portion of glutinous
matter, which was instantly carried out in a line, consisting
of four finer ones, with a velocity equal, or nearly so, to
that with which the air moved, as was apparent from
observations made on the motion of detached lines similarly
exposed. The spiders, in the next place, carefully ascertained
whether their lines had become firmly attached to
any object or not, by pulling at them with the first pair of
legs; and if the result was satisfactory, after tightening
them sufficiently, they made them pass to the twig; then
discharging from their spinners, which they applied to the
spot where they stood, a little more of their liquid gum,
and committing themselves to these bridges of their own
constructing, they passed over them in safety, drawing a
second line after them, as a security in case the first gave
way, and so effected their escape.</p>

<p>"Such was invariably the result when spiders were
placed where the air was liable to be sensibly agitated: I
resolved, therefore, to put a bell-glass over them; and in
this situation they remained seventeen days, evidently
unable to produce a single line by which they could quit the
branch they occupied, without encountering the water at
its base; though, on the removal of the glass, they regained
their liberty with as much celerity as in the instances
already recorded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This experiment, which, from want of due precaution,
has misled so many distinguished naturalists, I have tried
with several geometric spiders, and always with the same
success.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_FE" id="FNanchor_FE"></a><a href="#Footnote_FE" class="fnanchor">[FE]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. Blackwall, from subsequent experiments, says he is
&ldquo;confident in affirming, that in motionless air spiders have
not the power of darting their threads even through the
space of half an inch.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_FF" id="FNanchor_FF"></a><a href="#Footnote_FF" class="fnanchor">[FF]</a> The following details are given in
confirmation of this opinion. Mr. Blackwall observed, the
1st Oct., 1826, a little before noon, with the sun shining
brightly, no wind stirring, and the thermometer in the shade
ranging from 55&deg;·5 to 64&deg;, a profusion of shining lines
crossing each other at every angle, forming a confused net-work,
covering the fields and hedges, and thickly coating
his feet and ankles, as he walked across a pasture. He was
more struck with the phenomenon, because on the previous
day a strong gale of wind had blown from the south, and as
gossamer is only seen in calm weather, it must have been all
produced within a very short time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What more particularly arrested my attention,&rdquo; says
Mr. Blackwall, "was the ascent of an amazing quantity of
webs, of an irregular, complicated structure, resembling
ravelled silk of the finest quality and clearest white; they
were of various shapes and dimensions, some of the largest
measuring upwards of a yard in length, and several inches
in breadth in the widest part; while others were almost as
broad as long, presenting an area of a few square inches
only.</p>

<p>"These webs, it was quickly perceived, were not formed
in the air, as is generally believed, but at the earth&rsquo;s surface.
The lines of which they were composed, being brought into
contact by the mechanical action of gentle airs, adhered
together, till, by continual additions, they were accumulated
into flakes or masses of considerable magnitude, on which
the ascending current, occasioned by the rarefaction of the
air contiguous to the heated ground, acted with so much
force as to separate them from the objects to which they
were attached, raising them in the atmosphere to a perpendicular
height of at least several hundred feet. I collected a
number of these webs about mid-day, as they rose; and
again in the afternoon, when the upward current had ceased,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
and they were falling; but scarcely one in twenty contained
a spider: though, on minute inspection, I found small
winged insects, chiefly aphides, entangled in most of them.</p>

<p>"From contemplating this unusual display of gossamer,
my thoughts were naturally directed to the animals which
produced it, and the countless myriads in which they
swarmed almost created as much surprise as the singular
occupation that engrossed them. Apparently actuated by
the same impulse, all were intent upon traversing the regions
of air: accordingly, after gaining the summits of various
objects, as blades of grass, stubble, rails, gates, &amp;c., by the
slow and laborious process of climbing, they raised themselves
still higher by straightening their limbs; and elevating
the abdomen, by bringing it from the usual horizontal
position into one almost perpendicular, they emitted from
their spinning apparatus a small quantity of the glutinous
secretion with which they construct their webs. This
viscous substance being drawn out by the ascending current
of rarefied air into fine lines several feet in length, was
carried upward, until the spiders, feeling themselves acted
upon with sufficient force in that direction, quitted their
hold of the objects on which they stood, and commenced
their journey by mounting aloft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whenever the lines became inadequate to the purpose
for which they were intended, by adhering to any fixed body,
they were immediately detached from the spinners, and so
converted into terrestrial gossamer, by means of the last pair
of legs, and the proceedings just described were repeated;
which plainly proves that these operations result from a
strong desire felt by the insects to effect an ascent.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_FG" id="FNanchor_FG"></a><a href="#Footnote_FG" class="fnanchor">[FG]</a> Mr.
Blackwall has recently read a paper (still unpublished) in
the Linnean Society, confirmatory of his opinions.</p>

<p>6.  Without going into the particulars of what agrees or
disagrees in the above experiments with our own observations,
we shall give a brief account of what we have actually
seen in our researches. (J. R.) So far as we have determined,
then, all the various species of spiders, how different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
soever the form of their webs may be, proceed in the circumstance
of shooting their lines precisely alike; but those
which we have found the most manageable in experimenting,
are the small gossamer spider (<i>Aranea obtextrix</i>, <span class="smcap">Bechstein</span>),
known by its shining blackish-brown body and reddish-brown
semi-transparent legs; but particularly the long-bodied
spider (<i>Tetragnatha extensa</i>, <span class="smcap">Latr.</span>), which varies in colour
from green to brownish or grey&mdash;but has always a black line
along the belly, with a silvery white or yellowish one on
each side. The latter is chiefly recommended by being a
very industrious and persevering spinner, while its movements
are easily seen, from the long cylindrical form of its body
and the length of its legs.</p>

<p>We placed the above two species with five or six others,
including the garden, the domestic and the labyrinthic
spiders, in empty wine-glasses, set in tea-saucers filled with
water to prevent their escape. When they discovered, by
repeated descents from the brims of the glasses, that they
were thus surrounded by a wet ditch, they all set themselves
to the task of throwing their silken bridges across.
For this purpose they first endeavoured to ascertain in what
direction the wind blew, or rather (as the experiment was
made in our study) which way any current of air set,&mdash;by
elevating their arms as we have seen sailors do in a dead
calm. But, as it may prove more interesting to keep to one
individual, we shall first watch the proceedings of the
gossamer spider.</p>

<p>Finding no current of air on any quarter of the brim of
the glass, it seemed to give up all hopes of constructing its
bridge of escape, and placed itself in the attitude of repose;
but no sooner did we produce a stream of air, by blowing
gently towards its position, than, fixing a thread to the
glass, and laying hold of it with one of its feet, by way of
security, it placed its body in a vertical position, with its
spinnerets extended outwards; and immediately we had
the pleasure of seeing a thread streaming out from them
several feet in length, on which the little aëronaut sprung
up into the air. We were convinced, from what we thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
observed, that it was the double or bend of the thread
which was blown into the air; and we assigned as a reason
for her previously attaching and drawing out a thread from
the glass, the wish to give the wind a <i>point d&rsquo;appui</i>&mdash;something
upon which it might have a <i>purchase</i>, as a mechanic
would say of a lever. The bend of the thread, then, on this
view of the matter, would be carried out by the wind,&mdash;would
form the point of impulsion,&mdash;and, of course, the
escape bridge would be an ordinary line doubled.</p>

<p>Such was our conclusion, which was strongly corroborated
by what we subsequently found said by M. Latreille&mdash;than
whom no higher authority could be given. &ldquo;When
the animal,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;desires to cross a brook, she fixes to
a tree or some other object one of the ends of her first
threads, in order that the wind or a current of air may carry
the other end beyond the obstacle;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_FH" id="FNanchor_FH"></a><a href="#Footnote_FH" class="fnanchor">[FH]</a> and as one end is
always attached to the spinnerets, he must mean that the
double of the thread flies off. In his previous publications,
however, Latreille had contented himself with copying the
statement of Dr. Lister.</p>

<p>In order to ascertain the fact, and put an end to all
doubts, we watched, with great care and minuteness, the
proceedings of the long-bodied spider above mentioned, by
producing a stream of air in the same manner, as it perambulated
the brim of the glass. It immediately, as the other
had done, attached a thread, and raised its body perpendicularly,
like a tumbler, standing on his hands with his
head downwards; but we looked in vain for this thread
bending, as we had at first supposed, and going off double.
Instead of this it remained tight, while another thread, or
what appeared to be so, streamed off from the spinners,
similar to smoke issuing through a pin-hole, sometimes in a
line, and sometimes at a considerable angle, with the first,
according to the current of the air,&mdash;the first thread, extended
from the glass to the spinnerets, remaining all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
while tight drawn in a right line. It further appeared to
us, that the first thread proceeded from the pair of spinnerets
nearest the head, while the floating thread came
from the outer pair,&mdash;though it is possible in such minute
objects we may have been deceived. That the first was
continuous with the second, without any perceptible joining,
we ascertained in numerous instances, by catching the
floating line and pulling it tight, in which case the spider
glides along without attaching another line to the glass;
but if she has to coil up the floating line to tighten it, as
usually happens, she gathers it into a packet and glues the
two ends tight together. Her body, while the floating line
streamed out, remained quite motionless, but we distinctly
saw the spinnerets not only projected, as is always done
when a spider spins, but moved in the same way as an
infant moves its lips when sucking. We cannot doubt,
therefore, that this motion is intended to emit (if <i>eject</i> or
<i>project</i> be deemed too strong words) the liquid material of
the thread; at the same time, we are quite certain that it
cannot throw out a single inch of thread without the aid of
a current of air. A long-bodied spider will thus throw out
in succession as many threads as we please, by simply blowing
towards it; but not one where there is no current, as
under a bell-glass, where it may be kept till it die, without
being able to construct a bridge over water of an inch long.
We never observed more than one floating thread produced
at the same time; though other observers mention several.</p>

<p>The probable commencement, we think, of the floating
line, is by the emission of little globules of the glutinous
material to the points of the spinnerules&mdash;perhaps it may
be dropped from them, if not ejected, and the globules
being carried off by the current of air, drawn out into a
thread. But we give this as only a conjecture, for we could
not bring a glass of sufficient power to bear upon the spinnerules
at the commencement of the floating line.</p>

<p>In subsequent experiments we found that it was not indispensable
for the spider to rest upon a solid body when
producing a line, as she can do so while she is suspended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
in the air by another line. When the current of air also is
strong, she will sometimes commit herself to it by swinging
from the end of the line. We have even remarked this when
there was scarcely a breath of air.</p>

<p>We tried another experiment. We pressed pretty firmly
upon the base of the spinnerets, so as not to injure the
spider, blowing obliquely over them; but no floating line
appeared. We then touched them with a pencil and drew
out several lines an inch or two in length, upon which we
blew in order to extend them; but in this also we were
unsuccessful, as they did not lengthen more than a quarter
of an inch. We next traced out the reservoirs of a garden-spider
(<i>Epeira diadema</i>), and immediately taking a drop of
the matter from one of them on the point of a fine needle,
we directed upon it a strong current of air, and succeeded
in blowing out a thick yellow line, as we might have done
with gum-water, of about an inch and a half long.</p>

<p>When we observed our long-bodied spider eager to
throw a line by raising up its body, we brought within
three inches of its spinnerets an excited stick of sealing-wax,
of which it took no notice, nor did any thread
extend to it, not even when brought almost to touch the
spinnerets. We had the same want of success with an
excited glass rod; and indeed we had not anticipated any
other result, as we have never observed that these either
attract or repel the floating threads, as Mr. Murray has
seen them do; nor have we ever seen the end of a floating
thread separated into its component threadlets and
diverging like a brush, as he and Mr. Bowman describe.
It may be proper to mention that Mr. Murray, in conformity
with his theory, explains the shooting of lines in
a current of air by the electric state produced by motion
in consequence of the mutual friction of the gaseous particles.
But this view of the matter does not seem to affect
our statements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Nests, Webs, and Nets of Spiders.</p>

<p>The neatest, though the smallest spider&rsquo;s nest which we
have seen, was constructed in the chink of a garden post,
which we had cut out in the previous summer in getting at
the cells of a carpenter-bee. The architect was one of the
large hunting-spiders, erroneously said by some naturalists
to be incapable of spinning. The nest in question was about
two inches high, composed of a very close satin-like texture.
There were two parallel chambers placed perpendicularly,
in which position also the inhabitant reposed there during
the day, going, as we presume, only abroad to prey during
the night. But the most remarkable circumstance was, that
the openings (two above and two below) were so elastic, that
they shut almost as closely as the boat cocoon of the <i>Tortrix
Chlorana</i>. We observed this spider for several months, but
at last it disappeared, and we took the nest out, under the
notion that it might contain eggs; but we found none, and
therefore conclude that it was only used as a day retreat.
(J. R.) The account which Evelyn has given of these
hunting-spiders is so interesting, that we must transcribe it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of all sorts of insects,&rdquo; says he, "there is none has
afforded me more divertisement than the <i>venatores</i> (hunters),
which are a sort of <i>lupi</i> (wolves) that have their dens in
rugged walls and crevices of our houses; a small brown
and delicately-spotted kind of spiders, whose hinder legs
are longer than the rest. Such I did frequently observe
at Rome, which, espying a fly at three or four yards&rsquo;
distance, upon the balcony where I stood, would not
make directly to her, but crawl under the rail till, being
arrived at the antipodes, it would steal up, seldom missing
its aim; but if it chanced to want anything of being
perfectly opposite, would, at first peep, immediately slide
down again,&mdash;till, taking better notice, it would come the
next time exactly upon the fly&rsquo;s back: but if this happened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
not to be within a competent leap, then would this insect
move so softly, as the very shadow of the gnomon seemed
not to be more imperceptible, unless the fly moved; and
then would the spider move also in the same proportion,
keeping that just time with her motion, as if the same
soul had animated both these little bodies; and whether
it were forwards, backwards, or to either side, without at all
turning her body like a well-managed horse: but if the
capricious fly took wing and pitched upon another place
behind our huntress, then would the spider whirl its body
so nimbly about, as nothing could be imagined more
swift: by which means she always kept the head towards
her prey, though, to appearance, as immovable as if it had
been a nail driven into the wood, till by that indiscernible
progress (being arrived within the sphere of her reach)
she made a fatal leap, swift as lightning, upon the fly,
catching him in the pole, where she never quitted hold till
her belly was full, and then carried the remainder home."</p>

<p>One feels a little sceptical, however, when he adds,
&ldquo;I have beheld them instructing their young ones how
to hunt, which they would sometimes discipline for not
well observing; but when any of the old ones did (as
sometimes) miss a leap, they would run out of the field
and hide themselves in their crannies, as ashamed, and
haply not to be seen abroad for four or five hours after;
for so long have I watched the nature of this strange
insect, the contemplation of whose so wonderful sagacity
and address has amazed me; nor do I find in any chase
whatsoever more cunning and stratagem observed. I
have found some of these spiders in my garden, when
the weather, towards spring, is very hot, but they are
nothing so eager in hunting as in Italy.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_FI" id="FNanchor_FI"></a><a href="#Footnote_FI" class="fnanchor">[FI]</a></p>

<p>We have only to add to this lively narrative, that the
hunting-spider, when he leaps, takes good care to provide
against accidental falls by always swinging himself from
a good strong cable of silk, as Swammerdam correctly
states,<a name="FNanchor_FJ" id="FNanchor_FJ"></a><a href="#Footnote_FJ" class="fnanchor">[FJ]</a> and which anybody may verify, as one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
small hunters (<i>Salticus scenicus</i>), known by having its back
striped with black and white like a zebra, is very common
in Britain.</p>

<p>Mr. Weston, the editor of &lsquo;Bloomfield&rsquo;s Remains,&rsquo; falls
into a very singular mistake about hunting-spiders, imagining
them to be web-weaving ones which have exhausted
their materials, and which are therefore compelled to
hunt. In proof of this he gives an instance which fell
under his own observation!<a name="FNanchor_FK" id="FNanchor_FK"></a><a href="#Footnote_FK" class="fnanchor">[FK]</a></p>

<p>As a contrast to the little elastic satin nest of the hunter,
we may mention the largest with which we are acquainted,&mdash;that
of the labyrinthic spider (<i>Agelena labyrinthica</i>, <span class="smcap">Walchenaer</span>).
Our readers must often have seen this nest spread
out like a broad sheet in hedges, furze, and other low bushes,
and sometimes on the ground. The middle of this sheet,
which is of a close texture, is swung like a sailor&rsquo;s hammock,
by silken ropes extended all around to the higher branches;
but the whole curves upwards and backwards, sloping down
to a long funnel-shaped gallery which is nearly horizontal at
the entrance, but soon winds obliquely till it becomes quite
perpendicular. This curved gallery is about a quarter of an
inch in diameter, is much more closely woven than the sheet
part of the web, and sometimes descends into a hole in the
ground, though oftener into a group of crowded twigs, or a
tuft of grass. Here the spider dwells secure, frequently
resting with her legs extended from the entrance of the
gallery, ready to spring out upon whatever insect may fall
into her sheet net. She herself can only be caught by
getting behind her and forcing her out into the web; but
though we have often endeavoured to make her construct a
nest under our eye, we have been as unsuccessful as in
similar experiments with the common house spider (<i>Aranea
domestica</i>). (J. R.)</p>

<p>The house spider&rsquo;s proceedings were long ago described
by Homberg, and the account has been copied, as usual, by
almost every subsequent writer. Goldsmith has, indeed,
given some strange misstatements from his own observations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
and Bingley has added the original remark, that, after fixing
its first thread, creeping along the wall, and joining it as it
proceeds, it &ldquo;<i>darts itself to the opposite side</i>, where the other
end is to be fastened!&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_FL" id="FNanchor_FL"></a><a href="#Footnote_FL" class="fnanchor">[FL]</a> Homberg&rsquo;s spider took the more
circuitous route of travelling to the opposite wall, carrying
in one of the claws the end of the thread previously fixed,
lest it should stick in the wrong place. This we believe to
be the correct statement, for as the web is always horizontal,
it would seldom answer to commit a floating thread to the
wind, as is done by other species. Homberg&rsquo;s spider, after
stretching as many lines by way of <i>warp</i> as it deemed
sufficient between the two walls of the corner which it had
chosen, proceeded to cross this in the way our weavers do in
adding the <i>woof</i>, with this difference, that the spider&rsquo;s threads
were only laid on, and not interlaced.<a name="FNanchor_FM" id="FNanchor_FM"></a><a href="#Footnote_FM" class="fnanchor">[FM]</a> The domestic
spiders, however, in these modern days, must have forgot
this mode of weaving, for none of their webs will be found
to be thus regularly constructed!</p>

<p>The geometric, or net-working spiders (<i>Tendeuses</i>, <span class="smcap">Latr.</span>),
are as well known in most districts as any of the preceding;
almost every bush and tree in the gardens and hedge-rows
having one or more of their nets stretched out in a vertical
position between adjacent branches. The common garden
spider (<i>Epeira diadema</i>), and the long-bodied spider (<i>Tetragnatha
extensa</i>), are the best known of this order.</p>

<p>The chief care of a spider of this sort is, to form a cable
of sufficient strength to bear the net she means to hang upon
it; and, after throwing out a floating line as above described,
when it catches properly she doubles and redoubles it with
additional threads. On trying its strength she is not contented
with the test of pulling it with her legs, but drops
herself down several feet from various points of it, as we
have often seen, swinging and bobbing with the whole weight
of her body. She proceeds in a similar manner with the
rest of the framework of her wheel-shaped net; and it may
be remarked that some of the ends of these lines are not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
simple, but in form of a Y, giving her the additional security
of two attachments instead of one.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 454px;">
<img src="images/387.png" width="454" height="451" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Geometric Net of <i>Epeira diadema</i>.</span>
</div>

<p>In constructing the body of the net, the most remarkable
circumstance is her using her limbs as a measure, to regulate
the distances of her <i>radii</i> or wheel-spokes, and the circular
meshes interweaved into them. These are consequently
always proportional to the size of the spider. She often
takes up her station in the centre, but not always, though it
is so said by inaccurate writers; for she as frequently lurks
in a little chamber constructed under a leaf or other shelter
at the corner of her web, ready to dart down upon whatever
prey may be entangled in her net. The centre of the net is
said also to be composed of more viscid materials than its
suspensory lines,&mdash;a circumstance alleged to be proved by
the former appearing under the microscope studded with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
globules of gum.<a name="FNanchor_FN" id="FNanchor_FN"></a><a href="#Footnote_FN" class="fnanchor">[FN]</a> We have not been able to verify this
distinction, having seen the suspensory lines as often studded
in this manner as those in the centre. (J. R.)</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Mason-Spiders.</p>

<p>A no less wonderful structure is composed by a sort of
spiders, natives of the tropics and the south of Europe, which
have been justly called mason-spiders by M. Latreille. One
of these (<i>Mygale nidulans</i>, <span class="smcap">Walckn.</span>), found in the West
Indies, &ldquo;digs a hole in the earth obliquely downwards about
three inches in length, and one in diameter. This cavity
she lines with a tough thick web, which, when taken out,
resembles a leathern purse; but, what is most curious, this
house has a door with hinges, like the operculum of some
sea-shells, and herself and family, who tenant this nest, open
and shut the door whenever they pass and repass. This
history was told me,&rdquo; says Darwin, &ldquo;and the nest, with its
door, shown me by the late Dr. Butt, of Bath, who was some
years physician in Jamaica.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_FO" id="FNanchor_FO"></a><a href="#Footnote_FO" class="fnanchor">[FO]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The nest of a mason-spider, similar to this, has been
obligingly put into our hands by Mr. Riddle, of Blackheath.
It came from the West Indies, and is probably that of
Latreille&rsquo;s clay-kneader (<i>Mygale cratiens</i>), and one of the
smallest of the genus. We have since seen a pair of these
spiders in possession of Mr. William Mello, of Blackheath.
The nest is composed of very hard argillaceous clay, deeply
tinged with brown oxide of iron. It is in form of a tube,
about one inch in diameter, between six and seven inches
long, and slightly bent towards the lower extremity&mdash;appearing
to have been mined into the clay rather than built.
The interior of the tube is lined with a uniform tapestry of
silken web, of an orange-white colour, with a texture intermediate
between India paper and very fine glove leather.
But the most wonderful part of this nest is its entrance,
which we look upon as the perfection of insect architecture.
A circular door, about the size of a crown piece, slightly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
concave on the outside and convex within, is formed of more
than a dozen layers of the same web which lines the interior,
closely laid upon one another, and shaped so that the inner
layers are the broadest, the outer being gradually less in
diameter, except towards the hinge, which is about an inch
long; and in consequence of all the layers being united there,
and prolonged into the tube, it becomes the thickest and
strongest part of the structure. The elasticity of the
materials, also, gives to this hinge the remarkable peculiarity
of acting like a spring, and shutting the door of the nest
spontaneously. It is, besides, made to fit so accurately to
the aperture, which is composed of similar concentric layers of
web, that it is almost impossible to distinguish the joining
by the most careful inspection. To gratify curiosity, the
door has been opened and shut hundreds of times, without in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
the least destroying the power of the spring. When the
door is shut, it resembles some of the lichens (<i>Lecidea</i>), or
the leathery fungi, such as <i>Polyporus versicolor</i> (<span class="smcap">Micheli</span>), or,
nearer still, the upper valve of a young oyster shell. The
door of the nest, the only part seen above ground, being of a
blackish-brown colour, it must be very difficult to discover. (J. R.)</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 169px;">
<img src="images/391.png" width="169" height="509" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Another mason-spider (<i>Mygale cæmentaria</i>, <span class="smcap">Latr.</span>), found
in the south of France, usually selects for her nest a place
bare of grass, sloping in such a manner as to carry off the
water, and of a firm soil, without rocks or small stones.
She digs a gallery a foot or two in depth, and of a diameter
(equal throughout) sufficient to admit of her easily passing.
She lines this with a tapestry of silk glued to the walls.
The door, which is circular, is constructed of many layers of
earth kneaded, and bound together with silk. Externally,
it is flat and rough, corresponding to the earth around the
entrance, for the purpose, no doubt, of concealment: on the
inside it is convex, and tapestried thickly with a web of fine
silk. The threads of this door-tapestry are prolonged, and
strongly attached to the upper side of the entrance, forming
an excellent hinge, which, when pushed open by the spider,
shuts again by its own weight, without the aid of spring
hinges. When the spider is at home, and her door forcibly
opened by an intruder, she pulls it strongly inwards, and
even when half-opened often snatches it out of the hand; but
when she is foiled in this, she retreats to the bottom of her
den, as her last resource.<a name="FNanchor_FP" id="FNanchor_FP"></a><a href="#Footnote_FP" class="fnanchor">[FP]</a></p>

<p>Rossi ascertained that the female of an allied species
(<i>Mygale sauvagesii</i>, <span class="smcap">Latr.</span>), found in Corsica, lived in one of
these nests, with a numerous posterity. He destroyed one
of these doors to observe whether a new one would be made,
which it was; but it was fixed immovably, without a hinge;
the spider, no doubt, fortifying herself in this manner till she
thought she might reopen it without danger.<a name="FNanchor_FQ" id="FNanchor_FQ"></a><a href="#Footnote_FQ" class="fnanchor">[FQ]</a></p>

<p>[The accompanying illustration shows one of these nests,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
which is in my own collection. It was brought from Jamaica,
together with the spider that made it.</p>

<p>The nest is nearly six inches in
length, and is made of a double layer
of silken web. The inner layer is yellowish,
with a tinge of red, and although
fine, very tough and strong. The outer
layer is thick, coarse, dark brown, and
rather flaky, the dark colour being
probably caused by the earth which is
mixed with it. The lid is made of
eight or ten layers of coarse web, overlapping
each other like the tiles of a
house-roof, and the entrance of the nest
is formed after the same fashion. If
the lid be opened, the inside of the nest
is seen to be of a different make from
the exterior, being greyish-white,
smooth, close-textured, and looking
much like the finest kid leather.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Rev. Revett Shepherd has often
noticed, in the fen ditches of Norfolk,
a very large spider (the species not yet
determined) which actually forms a <i>raft</i> for the purpose of
obtaining its prey with more facility. Keeping its station
upon a ball of weeds about three inches in diameter, probably
held together by slight silken cords, it is wafted along the
surface of the water upon this floating island, which it quits
the moment it sees a drowning insect. The booty thus seized
it devours at leisure upon its raft, under which it retires
when alarmed by any danger.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_FR" id="FNanchor_FR"></a><a href="#Footnote_FR" class="fnanchor">[FR]</a> In the spring of 1830, we
found a spider on some reeds in the Croydon Canal, which
agreed in appearance with Mr. Shepherd&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>
<p>Among our native spiders there are several besides this
one, which, not contented with a web like the rest of their
congeners, take advantage of other materials to construct
cells where, &ldquo;hushed in grim repose,&rdquo; they &ldquo;expect their
insect prey.&rdquo; The most simple of those spider-cells is
constructed by a longish-bodied spider (<i>Aranea holosericea</i>,
<span class="smcap">Linn.</span>), which is a little larger than the common hunting-spider.
It rolls up a leaf of the lilac or poplar, precisely
in the same manner as is done by the leaf-rolling caterpillars,
upon whose cells it sometimes seizes to save itself
trouble, having first expelled, or perhaps devoured, the
rightful owner. The spider, however, is not satisfied with
the tapestry of the caterpillar, but always weaves a fresh set
of her own, much more close and substantial.</p>

<p>Another spider, common in woods and copses (<i>Epeira
quadrata?</i>), weaves together a great number of leaves to
form a dwelling for herself, and in front of it she spreads
her toils for entrapping the unwary insects which stray
thither. These, as soon as caught, are dragged into her den,
and stored up for a time of scarcity. Here also her eggs
are deposited and hatched in safety. When the cold weather
approaches, and the leaves of her edifice wither, she abandons
it for the more secure shelter of a hollow tree, where she
soon dies; but the continuation of the species depends upon
eggs, deposited in the nest before winter, and remaining
to be hatched with the warmth of the ensuing summer.</p>

<p>The spider&rsquo;s den of united leaves, however, which has
just been described, is not always useless when withered and
deserted, for the dormouse usually selects it as a ready-made
roof for its nest of dried grass. That those old spiders&rsquo; dens
are not accidentally chosen by the mouse, appears from the
fact, that out of about a dozen mouse-nests of this sort
found during winter in a copse between Lewisham and
Bromley, Kent, every second or third one was furnished with
such a roof. (J. R.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Diving Water-Spider.</p>

<p>Though spiders require atmospheric air for respiration,
yet one species well known to naturalists is aquatic in its
habits, and lives not only upon the surface but below the
surface of the water, contriving to carry down with it a
sufficiency of air for the support of life during a considerable
period of time. Its subaqueous nest is in fact a sort of
diving-bell, and constitutes a secure and most ingenious habitation.
This spider does not like stagnant water, but prefers
low running streams, canals, and ditches, where she may
often be seen in the vicinity of London and elsewhere, living
in her diving-bell, which shines through the water like
a little globe of silver: her singular economy was first,
we believe, described by Clerck,<a name="FNanchor_FS" id="FNanchor_FS"></a><a href="#Footnote_FS" class="fnanchor">[FS]</a> L. M. de Lignac,<a name="FNanchor_FT" id="FNanchor_FT"></a><a href="#Footnote_FT" class="fnanchor">[FT]</a> and De
Geer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The shining appearance,&rdquo; says Clerck, "proceeds either
from an inflated globule surrounding the abdomen, or from
the space between the body and the water. The spider,
when wishing to inhale the air, rises to the surface, with its
body still submersed, and only the part containing the
spinneret rising just to the surface, when it briskly opens
and moves its four teats. A thick coat of hair keeps the
water from approaching or wetting the abdomen. It comes
up for air about four times an hour or oftener, though I have
good reason to suppose it can continue without it for several
days together.</p>

<p>"I found in the middle of May one male and ten females,
which I put into a glass filled with water, where they lived
together very quietly for eight days. I put some duckweed
(<i>Lemna</i>) into the glass to afford them shelter, and the females
began to stretch diagonal threads in a confused manner from
it to the sides of the glass about half-way down. Each of
the females afterwards fixed a close bag to the edge of the
glass, from which the water was expelled by the air from the
spinneret, and thus a cell was formed capable of containing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
the whole animal. Here they remained quietly, with their
abdomens in their cells, and their bodies still plunged in the
water; and in a short time brimstone-coloured bags of eggs
appeared in each cell, filling it about a fourth part. On the
7th of July several young ones swam out from one of the
bags. All this time the old ones had nothing to eat, and yet
they never attacked one another as other spiders would have
been apt to do."<a name="FNanchor_FU" id="FNanchor_FU"></a><a href="#Footnote_FV" class="fnanchor">[FU]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;These spiders,&rdquo; says De Geer, &ldquo;spin in the water a cell
of strong, closely-woven white silk, in the form of half the
shell of a pigeon&rsquo;s egg, or like a diving-bell. This is sometimes
left partly above water, but at others is entirely submersed,
and is always attached to the objects near it by a
great number of irregular threads. It is closed all round,
but has a large opening below, which, however, I found
closed on the 15th of December, and the spider living quietly
within, with her head downwards. I made a rent in this cell,
and expelled the air, upon which the spider came out; yet,
though she appeared to have been laid up for three months
in her winter quarters, she greedily seized upon an insect
and sucked it. I also found that the male as well as the
female constructs a similar subaqueous cell, and during
summer no less than in winter.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_FV" id="FNanchor_FV"></a><a href="#Footnote_FV" class="fnanchor">[FV]</a> We have recently kept
one of these spiders for several months in a glass of water,
where it built a cell half under water, in which it laid its
eggs.</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Cleanliness of Spiders.</p>

<p>When we look at the viscid material with which spiders
construct their lines and webs, and at the rough, hairy covering
(with a few exceptions) of their bodies, we might conclude
that they would be always stuck over with fragments
of the minute fibres which they produce. This, indeed, must
often happen, did they not take careful precautions to avoid
it; for we have observed that they seldom, if ever, leave a
thread to float at random, except when they wish to form a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
bridge. When a spider drops along a line, for instance, in
order to ascertain the strength of her web, or the nature of
the place below her, she invariably, when she reascends,
coils it up into a little ball, and throws it away. Her claws
are admirably adapted for this purpose, as well as for
walking along the lines, as may be readily seen by a magnifying
glass.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 309px;">
<img src="images/395.png" width="309" height="153" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Triple-clawed foot of a Spider, magnified.</span>
</div>

<p>There are three claws, one of which acts as a thumb, the
others being toothed like a comb, for gliding along the
lines. This structure, however, unfits it to walk, as flies
can do, upon any upright polished surface like glass;
although the contrary<a name="FNanchor_FW" id="FNanchor_FW"></a><a href="#Footnote_FW" class="fnanchor">[FW]</a> is erroneously asserted by the Abbé
de la Pluche. Before she can do so, she is obliged to construct
a ladder of ropes, as Mr. Blackwell remarks,<a name="FNanchor_FX" id="FNanchor_FX"></a><a href="#Footnote_FX" class="fnanchor">[FX]</a> by
elevating her spinneret as high as she can, and laying down
a step upon which she stands to form a second, and so on;
as any one may try by placing a spider at the bottom of a
very clean wine-glass.</p>

<p>The hairs of the legs, however, are always catching bits
of web and particles of dust; but these are not suffered
to remain long. Most people may have remarked that the
house-fly is ever and anon brushing its feet upon one another
to rub off the dust, though we have not seen it remarked in
authors that spiders are equally assiduous in keeping themselves
clean. They have, besides, a very efficient instrument
in their mandibles or jaws, which, like their claws,
are furnished with teeth; and a spider which appears to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
careless observer as resting idly, in nine cases out of ten
will be found slowly combing her legs with her mandibles,
beginning as high as possible on the thigh, and passing down
to the claws. The flue which she thus combs off is regularly
tossed away.</p>

<p>With respect to the house-spider (<i>A. domestica</i>), we are
told in books, that &ldquo;she from time to time clears away the
dust from her web, and sweeps the whole by giving it a
shake with her paw, so nicely proportioning the force of
her blow, that she never breaks anything.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_FY" id="FNanchor_FY"></a><a href="#Footnote_FY" class="fnanchor">[FY]</a> That spiders
may be seen shaking their webs in this manner, we readily
admit; though it is not, we imagine, to clear them of dust,
but to ascertain whether they are sufficiently sound and
strong.</p>

<p>We recently witnessed a more laborious process of cleaning
a web than merely shaking it. On coming down the
Maine by the steamboat from Frankfort, in August, 1829,
we observed the geometric-net of a conic-spider (<i>Epeira
conica</i>, <span class="smcap">Walck.</span>) on the framework of the deck, and as it
was covered with flakes of soot from the smoke of the
engine, we were surprised to see a spider at work on it;
for, in order to be useful, this sort of net must be clean.
Upon observing it a little closely, however, we perceived
that she was not constructing a net, but dressing up an old
one; though not, we must think, to save trouble, so much
as an expenditure of material. Some of the lines she
dexterously stripped of the flakes of soot adhering to them;
but in the greater number, finding that she could not get them
sufficiently clean, she broke them quite off, bundled them up,
and tossed them over. We counted five of these packets of
rubbish which she thus threw away, though there must have
been many more, as it was some time before we discovered
the man&oelig;uvre, the packets being so small as not to be readily
perceived, except when placed between the eye and the light.
When she had cleared off all the sooty lines, she began to
replace them in the usual way; but the arrival of the boat at
Mentz put an end to our observations. (J. R.) Bloomfield,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
the poet, having observed the disappearance of these bits of
ravelled web, imagined that the spider swallowed them; and
even says that he observed a garden spider moisten the
pellets before swallowing them!<a name="FNanchor_FZ" id="FNanchor_FZ"></a><a href="#Footnote_FZ" class="fnanchor">[FZ]</a> Dr. Lister, as we have
already seen, thought the spider retracted the threads within
the abdomen.</p>

<p class="caption2">STRUCTURES OF GALL-FLIES AND APHIDES.</p>


<p>Many of the processes which we have detailed bear some
resemblance to our own operations of building with
materials cemented together; but we shall now turn our attention
to a class of insect-architects, who cannot, so far as we
know, be matched in prospective skill by any of the higher
orders of animals. We refer to the numerous family which
have received the name of gall-flies,&mdash;a family which, as yet,
is very imperfectly understood, their economy being no less
difficult to trace than their species is to arrange in the
established systems of classification; though the latter has
been recently much improved by Mr. Westwood.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Small berry-shaped galls of the oak leaf, produced by <i>Cynips quercus folii</i>?</span>
</div>

<p>One of the most simple and very common instances of the
nests constructed by gall-insects, may be found in abundance
during the summer, on the leaves of the rose-tree, the
oak, the poplar, the willow (<i>Salix viminalis</i>), and many other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
trees, in the globular form of a berry, about the size of a
currant, and usually of a green colour, tinged with red, like
a ripe Alban or Baltimore apple.</p>

<p>When this psuedo-apple in miniature is cut into, it is
found to be fresh, firm, juicy, and hollow in the centre,
where there is either an egg or a grub safely lodged, and
protected from all ordinary accidents. Within this hollow
ball the egg is hatched, and the grub feeds securely on its
substance, till it prepares for its winter sleep, before changing
into a gall-fly (<i>Cynips</i>) in the ensuing summer. There
is a mystery as to the manner in which this gall-fly contrives
to produce the hollow miniature apples, each enclosing
one of her eggs; and the doubts attendant upon the
subject cannot, so far as our present knowledge extends, be
solved, except by plausible conjecture. Our earlier naturalists
were of opinion that it was the grub which produced
the galls, by eating, when newly hatched, through the cuticle
of the leaf, and remaining till the juices flowing from the
wound enveloped it, and acquired consistence by exposure to
the air. This opinion, however, plausible as it appeared to
be, was at once disproved by finding unhatched eggs on opening
the galls.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Ovipositor of Gall-fly, greatly magnified.</span>
</div>

<p>There can be no doubt, indeed, that the mother gall-fly
makes a hole in the plant for the purpose of depositing her
eggs. She is furnished with an admirable ovipositor for that
express purpose, and Swammerdam actually saw a gall-fly
thus depositing her eggs, and we have recently witnessed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
the same in several instances. In some of these insects the
ovipositor is conspicuously long, even when the insect is at
rest; but in others, not above a line or two of it is visible,
till the belly of the insect be gently pressed. When this is
done to the fly that produces the currant-gall of the oak,
the ovipositor may be seen issuing from a sheath in form of
a small curved needle, of a chestnut-brown colour, and of
a horny substance, and three times as long as it at first
appeared.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 356px;">
<img src="images/400.png" width="356" height="305" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Gall-fly, and mechanism of ovipositor, greatly magnified.</span>
</div>

<p>What is most remarkable in this ovipositor is, that it is
much longer than the whole body of the insect, in whose
belly it is lodged in a sheath, and, from its horny nature, it
cannot be either shortened or lengthened. It is on this
account that it is bent into the same curve as the body of
the insect. The mechanism by which this is effected is
similar to that of the tongue of the woodpeckers (<i>Picidæ</i>),
which, though rather short, can be darted out far beyond
the beak, by means of a forked bone at the root of the
tongue, which is thin and rolled up like the spring of a
watch. The base of the ovipositor of the gall-fly is, in a
similar way, placed near the anus, runs along the curvature
of the back, makes a turn at the breast, and then, following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
the curve of the belly, appears again near where it originates.
We copy from Réaumur his accurate sketch of this remarkable
structure.</p>

<p>With this instrument the mother gall-fly pierces the part
of a plant which she selects, and, according to our older
naturalists, &ldquo;ejects into the cavity a drop of her corroding
liquor, and immediately lays an egg or more there; the circulation
of the sap being thus interrupted, and thrown, by
the poison, into a fermentation that burns the contiguous
parts and changes the natural colour. The sap, turned
from its proper channel, extravasates and flows round the
eggs, while its surface is dried by the external air, and
hardens into a vaulted form.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_GA" id="FNanchor_GA"></a><a href="#Footnote_GA" class="fnanchor">[GA]</a> Kirby and Spence tell us,
that the parent fly introduces her egg &ldquo;into a puncture
made by her curious spiral sting, and in a few hours it
becomes surrounded with a fleshy chamber.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_GB" id="FNanchor_GB"></a><a href="#Footnote_GB" class="fnanchor">[GB]</a> M. Virey
says, the gall tubercle is produced by irritation, in the same
way as an inflamed tumor in an animal body, by the swelling
of the cellular tissue and the flow of liquid matter, which
changes the organization, and alters the natural external
form.<a name="FNanchor_GC" id="FNanchor_GC"></a><a href="#Footnote_GC" class="fnanchor">[GC]</a> This seems to be the received doctrine at present in
France.<a name="FNanchor_GD" id="FNanchor_GD"></a><a href="#Footnote_GD" class="fnanchor">[GD]</a></p>

<p>Sprengel, speaking of the rose-willow, says, the insect in
spring deposits its eggs in the leaf buds. &ldquo;The new
stimulus attracts the sap,&mdash;the type of the part becomes
changed, and from the prevailing acidity of the animal
juice, it happens, that in the rose and stock-shaped leaves
which are pushed out, a red instead of a green colour is
evolved.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_GE" id="FNanchor_GE"></a><a href="#Footnote_GE" class="fnanchor">[GE]</a></p>

<span class="fig_caption">Bedeguar Gall of the Rose, produced by <i>Cynips rosæ</i>.</span>
</div>

<p>Without pretending positively to state facts which are,
perhaps, beyond human penetration, we may view the process
in a rather different light. (J. R.) Following the
analogy of what is <i>known</i> to occur in the case of the saw-flies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
after the gall-fly has made a puncture and pushed her
egg into the hole, we may suppose that she covers it
over with some adhesive gluten or gum, or the egg itself,
as is usual among moths, &amp;c., may be coated over with
such a gluten. In either of these two cases, the gluten
will prevent the sap that flows through the puncture from
being scattered over the leaf and wasted; and the sap, being
thus confined to the space occupied by the eggs, will expand
and force outwards the pellicle of gluten that confines
it, till becoming thickened by evaporation and exposure to
the air, it at length shuts up the puncture, stops the further
escape of the sap, and the process is completed. This
explanation will completely account for the globular form of
the galls alluded to; that is, supposing the egg of the gall-fly
to be globular, and covered or coated with a pellicle of
gluten of uniform thickness, and consequently opposing uniform
resistance, or rather uniform expansibility, to the sap
pressing from within. It will also account for the remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
uniformity in the size of the gall apples; for the punctures
and the eggs being uniform in size, and the gluten, by
supposition, uniform in quantity, no more than the same
quantity of sap can escape in such circumstances.</p>

<p>But though this explanation appears to be plausible, it is
confessedly conjectural; for though Swammerdam detected
a gall-fly in the act of depositing her eggs, he did not attend
to this circumstance; and in the instances which we have
observed, some unlucky accident always prevented us from
following up our observations. The indefatigable Réaumur,
on one occasion, thought he would make sure of tracing the
steps of the process in the case of the gall-fly which produces
the substance called <i>bedeguar</i> on the wild rose-tree,
and to which we shall presently advert. His plan was to
enclose in a box, in which a brood of flies had just been
produced from a bedeguar, a living branch from a wild
rose-tree; but, to his great disappointment, no eggs were
laid, and no bedeguar formed. Upon further investigation,
he discovered that the brood of flies produced from the
bedeguar were not the genuine bedeguar insects at all, but
one of the parasite ichneumons (<i>Callimone bedeguaris</i>, <span class="smcap">Stephens</span>),
which had surreptitiously deposited their eggs there,
in order to supply their young with the bedeguar grubs, all
of which they appeared to have devoured. It may prove
interesting to look into the remarkable structure of the bedeguar
itself, which is very different from the globular galls
above described.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 253px;">
<img src="images/403.png" width="253" height="104" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">One of the bristles of the Bedeguar of the Rose magnified.</span>
</div>

<p>The gall-fly of the willow (<i>Cynips viminalis</i>) deposits, as
we have just seen, only a single egg on one spot; but the
bedeguar insect lays a large cluster of eggs on the extremity
of a growing branch of the wild rose-tree, making, probably,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
a proportionate number of punctures to procure materials
for the future habitation of her young progeny. As in the
former case, also, each of these eggs becomes (as we may
suppose) surrounded with the sap of the rose, enclosed in a
pellicle of gluten. The gluten, however, of the bedeguar
insect is not, it would appear, sufficiently tenacious to confine
the flowing sap within the dimensions of any of the
little clustered globes containing the eggs, for it oozes out
from numerous cracks or pores in the pellicle; which cracks
or pores, however, are not large enough to admit a human
hair. But this, so far from being a defect in the glutinous
pellicle of the bedeguar fly, is, as we shall presently see, of
great utility. The sap which issues from each of these
pores, instead of being evaporated and lost, shoots out into a
reddish-coloured, fibrous bristle.</p>

<p>It is about half an inch long, and, from the natural tendency
of the sap of the rose-tree to form prickles, these are
all over studded with weak pricklets. The bedeguar,
accordingly, when fully formed, has some resemblance, at a
little distance, to a tuft of reddish-brown hair or moss stuck
upon the branch. Sometimes this tuft is as large as a small
apple, and of a rounded but irregular shape; at other times
it is smaller, and in one instance mentioned by Réaumur,
only a single egg had been laid on a rose-leaf, and, consequently,
only one tuft was produced. Each member of the
congeries is furnished with its own tuft of bristles, arising
from the little hollow globe in which the egg or the grub is
lodged.</p>

<p>The prospective wisdom of this curious structure is
admirable. The bedeguar grubs live in their cells through
the winter, and as their domicile is usually on one of the
highest branches, it must be exposed to every severity of the
weather. But the close, non-conducting, warm, mossy collection
of bristles, with which it is surrounded, forms for the
soft, tender grubs a snug protection against the winter&rsquo;s
cold, till, through the influence of the warmth of the succeeding
summer, they undergo their final change into the winged
state; preparatory to which they eat their way with their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
sharp mandibles through the walls of their little cells, which
are now so hard as to be cut with difficulty by a knife.
(J. R.)</p>

<p>Another structure, similar in principle, though different
in appearance, is very common upon oak-trees, the termination
of a branch being selected as best suited for the purpose.
This structure is rather larger than a filbert, and is composed
of concentric leaves diverging from the base, and expanding
upwards, somewhat like an artichoke. Whether this leafy
structure is caused by a superinduced disease, as the French
think, or by the form of the pores in the pellicle of gluten
surrounding the eggs, or rather by the tendency of the
exuding sap of the oak to form leaves, has not been ascertained;
but that it is intended, as in the case of the bedeguar,
to afford an efficient protection against the weather to the
included eggs or grubs, there can be no doubt.</p>

<p>From the very nature of the process of forming willow-galls,
bedeguar, and the artichoke of the oak, whatever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
theory be adopted, it will be obvious that their growth must
be rapid; for the thickening of the exuded sap, which is
quickly effected by evaporation, will soon obstruct and
finally close the orifice of the puncture made by the parent
insect. It is accordingly asserted by Réaumur and other
observers, that all the species of galls soon reach their full
growth.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Leafy Gall of Dyer&rsquo;s Broom, produced by <i>Cynips genistæ</i>? A, gall, natural size; B,  a leaflet magnified.</span>
</div>

<p>A very minute reddish-coloured grub feeds upon dyer&rsquo;s
broom (<i>Genista</i>), producing a sort of gall, frequently globular,
but always studded with bristles, arising from the amorphous
leaves. The stem of the shrub passes through this
ball, which is composed of a great number of leaves, shorter
and broader than natural, and each rolled into the form of a
horn, the point of which ends in a bristle. In the interior
we find a thick fleshy substance, serving to sustain the leaves,
and also for the nourishment of the grubs, some of which are
within and some between the leaves. They are in prodigious
numbers,&mdash;hundreds being assembled in the small
gall, and so minute as scarcely to be perceived without the
aid of a magnifying glass. The bud of the plant attacked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
by those grubs, instead of forming a shoot, pushes out
nothing but leaves, and these are all rolled, and turned
round the stem. Some shrubs have several of these galls,
which are of various sizes, from that of a filbert to that of a
walnut.</p>

<p>A similar but still more beautiful production is found
upon one of the commonest of our indigenous willows (<i>Salix
purpurea</i>), which takes the name of <i>rose-willow</i>, more probably
from this circumstance than from the red colour of
its twigs. The older botanists, not being aware of the cause
of such excrescences, considered the plants so affected as
distinct species; and old Gerard accordingly figures and
describes the rose-willow as &ldquo;not only making a gallant
show, but also yielding a most cooling air in the heat of
summer, being set up in houses for decking the same.&rdquo;
The production in question, however, is nothing more than
the effect produced by a species of gall-fly (<i>Cynips salicis</i>)
depositing its eggs in the terminal shoot of a twig, and, like
the bedeguar and the oak artichoke, causing leaves to spring
out, of a shape totally different from the other leaves of the
tree, and arranged very much like the petals of a rose.
Decandolle says it is found chiefly on the <i>Salix helix</i>, <i>S. alba</i>,
and <i>S. riparia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_GF" id="FNanchor_GF"></a><a href="#Footnote_GF" class="fnanchor">[GF]</a></p>

<p>A production very like that of the rose-willow may be
commonly met with on the young shoots of the hawthorn,
the growth of the shoot affected being stopped, and a crowded
bunch of leaves formed at the termination. These leaves,
besides being smaller than natural, are studded with short
bristly prickles, from the sap (we may suppose) of the hawthorn
being prevented from rising into a fresh shoot, and
thrown out of its usual course in the formation of the arms.
These bristles appear indiscriminately on both sides of the
leaves, some of which are bent inwards, while others diverge
in their natural manner.</p>

<p>This is not caused by the egg or grub of a true gall-fly,
but by the small white tapering grub of some dipterous
insect, of which we have not ascertained the species, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
which is, probably, a <i>cecidomyia</i>. Each terminal shoot is inhabited
by a number of these&mdash;not lodged in cells, however,
but burrowing indiscriminately among the half-withered
brown leaves which occupy the centre of the production.
(J. R.)</p>

<p>A more remarkable species of gall than any of the above
we discovered, in June, 1829, on the twig of an oak in the
grounds of Mr. Perkins, at Lee, in Kent. When we first
saw it, we imagined that the twig was beset with some
species of the lanigerous aphides, similar to what is vulgarly
called the American or white blight (<i>Aphis lanata</i>); but on
closer examination we discarded this notion. The twig was
indeed thickly beset with a white downy, or rather woolly,
substance around the stem at the origin of the leaves, which
did not appear to be affected in their growth, being well
formed, healthy, and luxuriant. We could not doubt that
the woolly substance was caused by some insect; but though
we cut out a portion of it, we could not detect any egg or
grub, and we therefore threw the branch into a drawer,
intending to keep it as a specimen, whose history we might
complete at some subsequent period.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Semi-Gall of the Hawthorn, produced by <i>Cecidomyia</i>? drawn from a specimen.</span>
</div>

<p>A few weeks afterwards, on opening this drawer, we were
surprised to see a brood of several dozens of a species of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
gall-fly (<i>Cynips</i>), similar in form and size to that whose eggs
cause the bedeguar of the rose, and differing only in being of
a lighter colour, tending to a yellowish brown. We have
since met with a figure and description of this gall in Swammerdam.
We may remark that the above is not the first
instance which has occurred in our researches, of gall insects
outliving the withering of the branch or leaf from which
they obtain their nourishment.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 261px;">

<span class="fig_caption">Woolly Gall of the Oak, less than the natural size, caused by a <i>Cynips</i>, and drawn from a specimen.</span>
</div>

<p>The woolly substance on the branch of the oak which we
have described was similarly constituted with the bedeguar
of the rose, with this difference, that instead of the individual
cells being diffused irregularly through the mass, they were
all arranged at the off-goings of the leaf-stalks, each cell
being surrounded with a covering of the vegetable wool,
which the stimulus of the parent egg, or its gluten, had
caused to grow, and from each cell a perfect fly had issued.
We also remarked that there were several small groups of
individual cells, each of which groups was contained in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
species of calyx or cup of leaf-scales, as occurs also in the
well-known gall called the oak-apple.</p>

<p>We were anxious to watch the proceedings of these flies
in the deposition of their eggs, and the subsequent developments
of the gall-growths; and endeavoured for that purpose
to procure a small oak plant in a garden-pot; but we did
not succeed in this: and though they alighted on rose and
sweet-briar trees, which we placed in their way, we never
observed that they deposited any eggs upon them. In a
week or two the whole brood died, or disappeared. (J. R.)</p>

<p>There are some galls, formed on low-growing plants, which
are covered with down, hair, or wool, though by no means
so copiously as the one which we have just described.
Among the plants so affected are the germander speedwell,
wild thyme, ground-ivy, and others to which we shall afterwards
advert.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Oak-apple Galls, one being cut open to show the vessels running to granules.</span>
</div>

<p>The well-known oak-apple is a very pretty example of the
galls formed by insects; and this, when compared with other
galls which form on the oak, shows the remarkable difference
produced on the same plant by the punctures of insects of
different species. The oak-apple is commonly as large as a
walnut or small apple, rounded, but not quite spherical, the
surface being irregularly depressed in various places. The
skin is smooth, and tinged with red and yellow, like a ripe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
apple; and at the base there is, in the earlier part of the
summer, a calyx or cup of five or six small brown scaly
leaves; but these fall off as the season advances. If an oak-apple
be cut transversely, there is brought into view a
number of oval granules, each containing a grub, and
embedded in a fruit-looking fleshy substance, having fibres
running through it. As these fibres, however, run in the
direction of the stem, they are best exhibited by a vertical
section of the gall; and this also shows the remarkable
peculiarity of each fibre terminating in one of the granules,
like a footstalk, or rather like a vessel for carrying nourishment.
Réaumur, indeed, is of opinion that these fibres are
the diverted nervures of the leaves, which would have sprung
from the bud in which the gall-fly had inserted her eggs,
and actually do carry sap-vessels throughout the substance of
the gall.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Root Galls of the Oak, produced by <i>Cynips quercus inferus</i>? drawn from a specimen.</span>
</div>

<p>Réaumur says the perfect insects (<i>Cynips quercus</i>) issued
from his galls in June and the beginning of July, and were
of a reddish-amber colour. We have procured insects,
agreeing with Réaumur&rsquo;s description, from galls formed on
the bark or wood of the oak, at the line of junction between
the root and the stem. These galls are precisely similar in
structure to the oak-apple, and are probably formed at a
season when the fly perceives, instinctively, that the buds
of the young branches are unfit for the purpose of nidification.</p>

<p>There is another oak-gall, differing little in size and
appearance from the oak-apple, but which is very different
in structure, as, instead of giving protection and nourishment
to a number of grubs, it is only inhabited by one.
This sort of gall, besides, is hard and woody on the outside,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
resembling a little wooden ball of a yellowish colour, but
internally of a soft, spongy texture. The latter substance,
however, encloses a small hard gall, which is the immediate
residence of the included insect. Galls of this description
are often found in clusters of from two to seven, near the
extremity of a branch, not incorporated, however, but distinctly
separate.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 124px;">
<img src="images/412.png" width="124" height="226" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Woody Gall on a Willow branch, drawn from a specimen.</span>
</div>

<p>We have obtained a fly very similar to this from a very
common gall, which is formed on the branches of the
willow. Like the one-celled galls just described, this is of
a hard, ligneous structure, and forms an irregular protuberance,
sometimes at the extremity, and sometimes on the
body, of a branch. But instead of one, this has a considerable
number of cells, irregularly distributed through its
substance. The structure is somewhat spongy, but fibrous;
and externally the bark is smoother than that of the branch
upon which it grows. (J. R.)</p>

<p>The currant-galls (as the French call them) of the oak are
exactly similar, when formed on the leaves, to those which
we have first described as produced on the leaves of the
willow and other trees. But the name of currant-gall seems
still more appropriate to an excrescence which grows on the
catkins of the oak, giving them very much the appearance of
a straggling branch of currants or bird-cherries. The galls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
resemble currants which have fallen from the tree before
being ripe. These galls do not seem to differ from those
formed on the leaves of the oak; and are probably the production
of the same insect, which selects the catkin in preference,
by the same instinct that the oak-apple gall-fly, as
we have seen, sometimes deposits its eggs in the bark of the
oak near the root.</p>

<p>The gall of the oak, which forms an important dye-stuff,
and is used in making writing-ink, is also produced by a
<i>Cynips</i>, and has been described in the &lsquo;Library of Entertaining
Knowledge&rsquo; (Vegetable Substances, p. 16). The employment
of the <i>Cynips psenes</i> for ripening figs is described in

<p class="caption3 smcap">Gall of a Hawthorn Weevil.</p>

<p>In May, 1829, we found on a hawthorn at Lee, in Kent,
the leaves at the extremity of a branch neatly folded up in
a bundle, but not quite so closely as is usual in the case of
leaf-rolling caterpillars. On opening them, there was no
caterpillar to be seen, the centre being occupied with a
roundish, brown-coloured, woody substance, similar to some
excrescences made by gall-insects (<i>Cynips</i>). Had we been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
aware of its real nature, we should have put it immediately
under a glass or in a box, till the contained insect had developed
itself; but instead of this, we opened the ball, where we
found a small yellowish grub coiled up, and feeding on the
exuding juices of the tree. As we could not replace the
grub in its cell, part of the walls of which we had unfortunately
broken, we put it in a small pasteboard box with a
fresh shoot of hawthorn, expecting that it might construct a
fresh cell. This, however, it was probably incompetent to
perform: it did not at least make the attempt, and neither
did it seem to feed on the fresh branch, keeping in preference
to the ruins of its former cell. To our great surprise,
although it was thus exposed to the air, and deprived of a
considerable portion of its nourishment, both from the part
of the cell having been broken off, and from the juices of the
branch having been dried up, the insect went through its
regular changes, and appeared in the form of a small
greyish-brown beetle of the weevil family. The most remarkable
circumstance in the case in question, was the
apparent inability of the grub to construct a fresh cell after
the first was injured,&mdash;proving, we think, beyond a doubt,
that it is the puncture made by the parent insect when the
egg is deposited that causes the exudation and subsequent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
concretion of the juices forming the gall. These galls were
very abundant during the summer of 1830. (J. R.)</p>

<p>A few other instances of beetles producing galls are recorded
by naturalists. Kirby and Spence have ascertained,
for example, that the bumps formed on the roots of kedlock
or charlock (<i>Sinapis arvensis</i>) are inhabited by the larvæ of a
weevil (<i>Curculio contractus</i>, <span class="smcap">Marsham</span>; and <i>Rhynch&oelig;nus
assimilis</i>, <span class="smcap">Fabr.</span>); and it may be reasonably supposed that
either the same or similar insects cause the clubbing of the
roots of cabbages, and the knob-like galls on turnips, called
in some places the <i>anbury</i>. We have found them also infesting
the roots of the hollyhock (<i>Alcea rosea</i>). They are
evidently beetles of an allied genus which form the woody
galls sometimes met with on the leaves of the guelder-rose
(<i>Viburnum</i>), the lime-tree (<i>Tilia Europæa</i>), and the beech
(<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>).</p>

<p>There are also some two-winged flies which produce
woody galls on various plants, such as the thistle-fly
(<i>Tephritis cardui</i>, <span class="smcap">Latr.</span>). The grubs of this pretty fly
produce on the leaf-stalks of thistles an oblong woody knob.
On the common white briony (<i>Bryonia dioica</i>) of our hedges
may be found a very pretty fly of this genus, of a yellowish-brown
colour, with pellucid wings, waved much like those of
the thistle-fly with yellowish brown. This fly lays its eggs
near a joint of the stem, and the grubs live upon its substance.
The joint swells out into an oval form, furrowed in
several places, and the fly is subsequently disclosed. In its
perfect state, it feeds on the blossom of the briony. (J. R.)
Flies of another minute family, the gall-gnats (<i>Cecidomyiæ</i>,
<span class="smcap">Latr.</span>), pass the first stage of their existence in the small
globular cottony galls which abound on germander speedwell
(<i>Veronica chamædrys</i>), wild thyme (<i>Thymus serpyllum</i>), and
ground-ivy (<i>Glechoma hederacea</i>). The latter is by no means
uncommon, and may be readily recognised.</p>

<p>Certain species of plant-lice (<i>Aphides</i>), whose complete
history would require a volume, produce excrescences upon
plants which may with some propriety be termed galls, or
semi-galls. Some of these are without any aperture, whilst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
others are in form of an inflated vesicle, with a narrow
opening on the under side of a leaf, and expanding (for the
most part irregularly) into a rounded knob on its upper
surface. The mountain-ash (<i>Pyrus aucuparia</i>) has its leaves
and young shoots frequently affected in this way, and sometimes
exhibits galls larger than a walnut or even than a
man&rsquo;s fist; at other times they do not grow larger than a
filbert. Upon opening one of these, they are found to be
filled with the <i>aphides sorbi</i>. If taken at an early stage of
their growth, they are found open on the under side of the
leaf, and inhabited only by a single female aphis, pregnant
with a numerous family of young. In a short time the
aperture becomes closed, in consequence of the insect making
repeated punctures round its edge, from which sap is exuded
and forms an additional portion of the walls of the cell.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 192px;">
<img src="images/416.png" width="192" height="137" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">A Plant-Louse (<i>Aphis</i>), magnified.</span>
</div>

<p>In this early stage of its growth, however, the gall does
not, like the galls of the cynips, increase very much in
dimensions. It is after the increase of the inhabitants by
the young brood that it grows with considerable rapidity;
for each additional insect, in order to procure food, has to
puncture the wall of the chamber and suck the juices, and
from the punctures thus made the sap exudes, and enlarges
the walls. As those galls are closed all round in the more
advanced state, it does not appear how the insects can ever
effect an exit from their imprisonment.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Galls produced on the leaves and leaf-stalks of the Poplar by <i>Eriosoma populi</i>, with the
various forms of the insects, winged, not winged, and covered with wool, both of the
natural size and magnified.</span>
</div>

<p>A much more common production, allied to the one just
described, may be found on the poplar in June and July.
Most of our readers may have observed, about midsummer, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
small snow-white tuft of downy-looking substance floating
about on the wind, as if animated. Those tufts of snow-white
down are never seen in numbers at the same time,
but generally single, though some dozens of them may be
observed in the course of one day. This singular object is
a four-winged fly (<i>Eriosoma populi</i>, <span class="smcap">Leach</span>), whose body is
thickly covered with long down&mdash;a covering which seems
to impede its flight, and make it appear more like an inanimate
substance floating about on the wind, than impelled
by the volition of a living animal. This pretty fly feeds
upon the fresh juices of the black poplar, preferring that of
the leaves and leaf-stalks, which it punctures for this
purpose with its beak. It fixes itself with this design to a
suitable place upon the principal nervure of the leaf, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
upon the leaf-stalk, and remains in the same spot till the
sap, exuding through the punctures, and thickening by
contact with the air, surrounds it with a thick fleshy wall of
living vegetable substance, intermediate in texture between
the wood and the leaf, being softer than the former and
harder than the latter. In this snug little chamber, secure
from the intrusion of lady-birds and the grubs of aphidivorous
flies (<i>Syrphi</i>), she brings forth her numerous brood
of young ones, who immediately assist in enlarging the
extent of their dwelling, by puncturing the walls. In one
respect, however, the galls thus formed differ from those of
the mountain-ash just described,&mdash;those of the poplar having
always an opening left into some part of the cell, and
usually in that portion of it which is elongated into an
obtuse beak. From this opening the young, when arrived
at the winged state, make their exit, to form new colonies;
and, during their migrations, attract the attention of the
most incurious by the singularity of their appearance.
(J. R.)</p>

<p>On the black poplar there may be found, later in the
season than the preceding, a gall of a very different form,
though, like the other, it is for the most part on the leaf-stalk.
The latter sort of galls are of a spiral form; and
though they are closed, they open upon slight pressure, and
appear to be formed of two laminæ, twisted so as to unite.
It is at this opening that an aperture is formed spontaneously
for the exit of the insects, when arrived at a perfect state.
In galls of this kind we find aphides, but of a different species
from the lanigerous ones, which form the horn-shaped galls
above described.</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Leaf-Rolling Aphides.</p>

<p>It may not be improper to introduce here a brief sketch
of some other effects, of a somewhat similar kind, produced
on leaves by other species of the same family (<i>Aphidæ</i>). In
all the instances of this kind which we have examined, the
form which the leaf takes serves as a protection to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
insects, both from the weather and from depredators. That
there is design in it appears from the circumstance of the
aphides crowding into the embowering vault which they
have formed; and we are not quite certain whether they do
not puncture certain parts of the leaf for the very purpose
of making it arch over them; at least, in many cases, such as
that of the hop-fly (<i>Aphis humuli</i>), though the insects are in
countless numbers, no arching of the leaves follows. The
rose-plant louse, again (<i>Aphis rosæ</i>), sometimes arches the
leaves, but more frequently gets under the protecting folds of
the half-expanded leaf-buds. (J. R.)</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 243px;">
<img src="images/419.png" width="243" height="337" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Leaf of the Currant-bush, bulged out by the <i>Aphis ribis</i>.</span>
</div>

<p>One of the most common instances of what we mean
occurs on the leaves of the currant-bush, which may often
be observed raised up into irregular bulgings, of a reddish-brown
colour. On examining the under side of such a leaf
there will be seen a crowd of small insects, some with and
some without wings, which are the <i>Aphides ribis</i> in their
different stages, feeding securely and socially on the juices of
the leaf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<p>The most remarkable instance of this, however, which we
have seen, occurs on the leaves of the elm, and is caused
by the <i>Aphis ulmi</i>. The edge of an elm-leaf inhabited by
those aphides is rolled up in an elegant convoluted form,
very much like a spiral shell; and in the embowered chamber
thus formed the insects are secure from rain, wind, and
partially from the depredations of carnivorous insects. One
of their greatest enemies, the lady-bird (<i>Coccinella</i>), seldom
ventures, as we have remarked, into concealed corners except
in cold weather, and contrives to find food enough among
the aphides which feed openly and unprotected, such as the
zebra aphides of the alder (<i>Aphides sambuci</i>). The grubs,
however, of the lady-bird, and also those of the aphidivorous
flies (<i>Syrphi</i>), may be found prying into the most secret
recesses of a leaf to prey upon the inhabitants, whose slow
movements disqualify them from effecting an escape. (J. R.)</p>

<p>The effect of the puncture of aphides on growing plants is
strikingly illustrated in the shoots of the lime-tree and
several other plants, which become bent and contorted on
the side attacked by the insects, in the same way that a shoot
might warp by the loss of its juices on the side exposed to a
brisk fire. The curvings thus effected become very advantageous
to the insects, for the leaves sprouting from the twig,
which naturally grow at a distance from each other, are
brought close together in a bunch, forming a kind of nosegay,
that conceals all the colour of the sprig, as well as the
insects which are embowered under it, protecting them
against the rain and the sun, and at the same time hiding them
from observation. It is only requisite, however, where
they have formed bowers of this description, to raise the
leaves, in order to see the little colony of the aphides,&mdash;or
the remains of those habitations which they have abandoned.
We have sometimes observed sprigs of the lime-tree, of a
thumb&rsquo;s thickness, portions of which resembled spiral
screws; but we could not certainly have assigned the true
cause for this twisting, had we not been acquainted with the
manner in which aphides contort the young shoots of this

tree.<a name="FNanchor_GG" id="FNanchor_GG"></a><a href="#Footnote_GG" class="fnanchor">[GG]</a> The shoots of the gooseberry and the willow are
sometimes contorted in the same way, but not so strikingly
as the shoots of the lime.</p>

<p class="caption3 smcap">Pseudo-Galls.</p>

<p>It may not be out of place to mention here certain anomalous
excrescences upon trees and other plants, which,
though they much resemble galls, are not so distinctly
traceable to the operations of any insect. In our researches
after galls, we have not unfrequently met with excrescences
which so very much resemble them, that before dissection
we should not hesitate to consider them as such, and predict
that they formed the nidus of some species of insects. In
more instances than one we have felt so strongly assured of
this, that we have kept several specimens for some months,
in nurse-boxes, expecting that in due time the perfect insect
would be disclosed.</p>

<p>One of these pseudo-galls occurs on the common bramble
(<i>Rubus fruticosus</i>), and bears some resemblance to the bedeguar
of the rose when old and changed by weather. It
clusters round the branches in the form of irregular granules,
about the size of a pea, very much crowded, the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
excrescence being rather larger than a walnut. We expected
to find this excrescence full of grubs, and were much surprised
to discover, upon dissection, that it was only a diseased
growth of the plant, caused (it might be) by the puncture of
an insect, but not for the purpose of a nidus or habitation.
(J. R.)</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Pseudo-gall of the Bramble, drawn from a specimen.</span>
</div>

<p>Another sort of excrescence is not uncommon on the
terminal shoots of the hawthorn. This is in general irregularly
oblong, and the bark which covers it is of an iron
colour, similar to the scoriæ of a blacksmith&rsquo;s forge. When
dissected, we find no traces of insects, but a hard, ligneous,
and rather porous texture. It is not improbable that this
excrescence may originate in the natural growth of a shoot
being checked by the punctures of aphides, or of those grubs
which we have described.</p>

<p>Many of these excrescences, however, are probably altogether
unconnected with insects, and are simply hypertrophic
diseases, produced by too much nourishment, like the wens
produced on animals. Instances of this may be seen at the
roots of the hollyhock (<i>Althea rosea</i>) of three or four years&rsquo;
standing; on the stems of the elm and other trees, immediately
above the root; and on the upper branches of the birch,
where a crowded cluster of twigs sometimes grows, bearing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
no distant resemblance to a rook&rsquo;s nest in miniature, and
provincially called witch-knots.</p>

</div>

<p>One of the prettiest of these pseudo-galls  with which we
are acquainted, is produced on the Scotch fir (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>),
by the <i>Aphis pini</i>, which is one of the largest species
of our indigenous aphides. The production
we allude to may be found, during the summer
months, on the terminal shoots of this
tree, in the form of a small cone, much like
the fruit of the tree in miniature, but with
this difference, that the fruit terminates in
a point, whereas the pseudo-gall is nearly globular.
Its colour also, instead of being green,
is reddish; but it exhibits the tiled scales of the fruit cone.</p>

<p>We have mentioned this the more willingly that it seems
to confirm the theory which we have hazarded respecting
the formation of the bedeguar of the rose and other true galls&mdash;by
which we ascribed to the sap, diverted from its natural
course by insects, a tendency to form leaves, &amp;c., like those
of the plant from which it is made to exude.</p>

<p>The structures which we have hitherto noticed have all
been formed of inanimate materials, or at the most of
growing vegetables; but those to which we shall now advert
are actually composed of the flesh of living animals, and
seem to be somewhat akin to the galls already described as
formed upon the shoots and leaves of plants. These were
first investigated by the accurate Vallisnieri, and subsequently
by Réaumur, De Geer, and Linnæus; but the best
account which has hitherto been given of them is by our
countryman Mr. Bracey Clark, who differs essentially from
his predecessors as to the mode in which the eggs are deposited.
As, in consequence of the extreme difficulty, if not the
impossibility, of personal observation, it is no easy matter to
decide between the conflicting opinions, we shall give such
of the statements as appear most plausible.</p>

<p>The mother breeze-fly (<i>Oestrus bovis</i>, <span class="smcap">Clark</span>;&mdash;<i>Hypoderma
bovis</i>, <span class="smcap">Latr.</span>), which produces the tumours in cattle called
<i>wurbles</i> or <i>wormuls</i> (<i>quasi</i>, <i>worm-holes</i>), is a two-winged insect,
smaller, but similar in appearance and colour to the carder-bee
(<a href="#Page_75">p. 75</a>), with two black bands, one crossing the shoulders
and the other the abdomen, the rest being covered with
yellow hair. This fly appears to have been first discovered
by Vallisnieri, who has given a curious and interesting
history of his observations upon its economy. &ldquo;After having
read this account,&rdquo; says Réaumur, "with sincere pleasure, I
became exceedingly desirous of seeing with my own eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
what the Italian naturalist had reported in so erudite and
pleasing a manner. I did not then imagine that it would
ever be my lot to speak upon a subject which had been
treated with so much care and elegance; but since I have
enjoyed more favourable opportunities than M. Vallisnieri, it
was not difficult for me to investigate some of the circumstances
better, and to consider them under a different point
of view. It is not, indeed, very wonderful to discover something
new in an object, though it has been already carefully
inspected with very good eyes, when we sit down to examine
it more narrowly, and in a more favourable position; while
it sometimes happens, also, that most indifferent observers
have detected what had been previously unnoticed by the
most skilful interpreters of nature."<a name="FNanchor_GI" id="FNanchor_GI"></a><a href="#Footnote_GI" class="fnanchor">[GI]</a></p>

<p>From the observations made by Réaumur, he concluded
that the mother-fly, above described, deposits her eggs in the
flesh of the larger animals, for which purpose she is furnished
with an ovipositor of singular mechanism. We have seen
that the ovipositors in the gall-flies (<i>Cynips</i>) are rolled up
within the body of the insect somewhat like the spring of a
watch, so that they can be thrust out to more than double
their apparent length. To effect the same purpose, the
ovipositor of the ox-fly lengthens, by a series of sliding tubes,
precisely like an opera-glass. There are four of these tubes,
as may be seen by pressing the belly of the fly till they come
into view. Like other ovipositors of this sort, they are composed
of a horny substance; but the terminal piece is very
different indeed from the same part in the gall-flies, the tree-hoppers
(<i>Cicadæ</i>), and the ichneumons, being composed of
five points, three of which are longer than the other two, and
at first sight not unlike a <i>fleur-de-lis</i>, though, upon narrower
inspection, they may be discovered to terminate in curved
points, somewhat like the claw of a cat. The two shorter
pieces are also pointed, but not curved; and by the union
of the five, a tube is composed for the passage of the eggs.</p>

<p>It would be necessary, Réaumur confesses, to see the fly
employ this instrument to understand in what manner it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
acts, though he is disposed to consider it fit for boring
through the hides of cattle. &ldquo;Whenever I have succeeded,&rdquo;
he adds, &ldquo;in seeing these insects at work, they have usually
shown that they proceeded quite differently from what I had
imagined; but unfortunately I have never been able to see
one of them pierce the hide of a cow under my eyes.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_GJ" id="FNanchor_GJ"></a><a href="#Footnote_GJ" class="fnanchor">[GJ]</a></p>

<span class="fig_caption">Ovipositor of the Breeze-fly, greatly magnified, with a claw and part of the tube, distinct.</span>
</div>

<p>Mr. Bracey Clark, taking another view of the matter, is
decidedly of opinion that the fly does not pierce the skin of
cattle with its ovipositor at all, but merely glues its eggs to
the hairs, while the grubs, when hatched, eat their way under
the skin. If this be the fact, as is not improbable, the three
curved pieces of the ovipositor, instead of acting, as Réaumur
imagined, like a centre-bit, will only serve to prevent the
eggs from falling till they are firmly glued to the hair, the
opening formed by the two shorter points permitting this to
be effected. This account of the matter is rendered more
plausible, from Réaumur&rsquo;s statement that the deposition of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
the egg is not attended by much pain, unless, as he adds,
some very sensible nervous fibres have been wounded.
According to this view, we must not estimate the pain
produced by the thickness of the instrument; for the sting
of a wasp, or a bee, although very considerably smaller than
the ovipositor of the ox-fly, causes a very pungent pain. It
is, in the latter case, the poison infused by the sting, rather
than the wound, which occasions the pain; and Vallisnieri
is of opinion that the ox-fly emits some acrid matter along
with her eggs, but there is no proof of this beyond conjecture.</p>

<p>It ought to be remarked, however, that cattle have very
thick hides, which are so far from being acutely sensitive of
pain, that in countries where they are put to draw ploughs
and waggons, they find a whip ineffectual to drive them, and
have to use a goad, in form of an iron needle, at the end of a
stick. Were the pain inflicted by the fly very acute, it would
find it next to impossible to lay thirty or forty eggs without
being killed by the strokes of the ox&rsquo;s tail; for though
Vallisnieri supposes that the fly is shrewd enough to choose
such places as the tail cannot reach, Réaumur saw a cow
repeatedly flap its tail upon a part full of the gall-bumps;
and in another instance he saw a heifer beat away a party
of common flies from a part where there were seven or eight
gall-bumps. He concludes, therefore, with much plausibility,
that these two beasts would have treated the ox-flies in
the same way, if they had given them pain when depositing
their eggs.</p>

<p>The extraordinary effects produced upon cattle, on the
appearance of one of these flies, would certainly lead us to
conclude that the pain inflicted is excruciating. Most of our
readers may recollect to have seen, in the summer months, a
whole herd of cattle start off across a field in full gallop, as
if they were racing,&mdash;their movements indescribably awkward&mdash;their
tails being poked out behind them as straight and
stiff as a post, and their necks stretched to their utmost
length. All this consternation has been known, from the
earliest times, to be produced by the fly we are describing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
Virgil gives a correct and lively picture of it in his Georgies,<a name="FNanchor_GK" id="FNanchor_GK"></a><a href="#Footnote_GK" class="fnanchor">[GK]</a>
of which the following is a translation, a little varied from
Trapp:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Round Mount Alburnus, green with shady oaks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the groves of Silarus, there flies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An insect pest (named <i>&OElig;strus</i> by the Greeks,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From glade to glade; the air, the woods, the banks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the dried river echo their loud bellowing.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Had we not other instances to adduce, of similar terror
caused among sheep, deer, and horses, by insects of the same
genus, which are ascertained not to penetrate the skin, we
should not have hesitated to conclude that Vallisnieri and
Réaumur are right, and Mr. Bracey Clark wrong. In the
strictly similar instance of Reindeer-fly (<i>&OElig;strus tarandi</i>,
<span class="smcap">Linn.</span>), we have the high authority of Linnæus for the fact,
that it lays its eggs <i>upon</i> the skin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remarked,&rdquo; he says, "with astonishment how greatly
the reindeer are incommoded in hot weather, insomuch that
they cannot stand still a minute, no not a moment, without
changing their posture, starting, puffing and blowing continually,
and all on account of a little fly. Even though
amongst a herd of perhaps five hundred reindeer, there were
not above ten of those flies, every one of the herd trembled
and kept pushing its neighbour about. The fly, meanwhile,
was trying every means to get at them; but it no sooner
touched any part of their bodies, than they made an immediate
effort to shake it off. I caught one of these insects
as it was flying along with its tail protruded, which had at
its extremity a small linear orifice perfectly white. The tail
itself consisted of four or five tubular joints, slipping into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
each other like a pocket spying-glass, which this fly, like
others, has a power of contracting at pleasure."<a name="FNanchor_GL" id="FNanchor_GL"></a><a href="#Footnote_GL" class="fnanchor">[GL]</a></p>

<p>In another work he is still more explicit. &ldquo;This well-known
fly,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;hovers the whole day over the back of
the reindeer, with its tail protruded and a little bent, upon
the point of which it holds a small white egg, scarcely so
large as a mustard-seed, and when it has placed itself in a
perpendicular position, it drops its egg, which rolls down
amongst the hair to the skin, where it is hatched by the
natural heat and perspiration of the reindeer, and the grub
eats its way slowly under the skin, causing a bump as large
as an acorn.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_GM" id="FNanchor_GM"></a><a href="#Footnote_GM" class="fnanchor">[GM]</a> The male and female of the reindeer breeze-fly
are figured in the &lsquo;Library of Entertaining Knowledge,
Menageries,&rsquo; vol. i. p. 405.</p>

<p>There is one circumstance which, though it appears to us
to be of some importance in the question, has been either
overlooked or misrepresented in books. &ldquo;While the female
fly,&rdquo; say Kirby and Spence, &ldquo;is performing the operation of
oviposition, the animal attempts to lash her off as it does
other flies, with its tail;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_GN" id="FNanchor_GN"></a><a href="#Footnote_GN" class="fnanchor">[GN]</a> though this is not only at variance
with their own words in the page but one preceding, where
they most accurately describe &ldquo;the herd with their tails in
the air, or turned upon their backs, or stiffly stretched out
in the direction of the spine,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_GO" id="FNanchor_GO"></a><a href="#Footnote_GO" class="fnanchor">[GO]</a> but with the two facts
mentioned above from Réaumur, as well as with common
observation. If the ox then do not attempt to lash off the
breeze-fly, but runs with its tail stiffly extended, it affords
a strong presumption that the fly terrifies him by her
buzzing (<i>asper</i>, <i>acerba sonans</i>), rather than pains him by
piercing his hide: her buzz, like the rattle of the rattlesnake,
being instinctively understood, and intended, it may
be, to prevent an over-population, by rendering it difficult to
deposit the eggs.</p>

<p>The horse breeze-fly (<i>Gasterophilus equi</i>, <span class="smcap">Leach</span>), which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
produces the maggots well known by the name of <i>botts</i> in
horses, is ascertained beyond a doubt to deposit her eggs
upon the hair; and as insects of the same genus almost
invariably proceed upon similar principles, however much
they may vary in minute particulars, it may be inferred
with justice, that the breeze-flies which produce galls do
the same. The description given by Mr. Bracey Clark, of
the proceedings of the horse breeze-fly, is exceedingly interesting.</p>

<p>"When the female has been impregnated, and her eggs
sufficiently matured, she seeks among the horses a subject
for her purpose, and approaching him on the wing, she
carries her body nearly upright in the air, and her tail,
which is <i>lengthened for the purpose</i>,<a name="FNanchor_GP" id="FNanchor_GP"></a><a href="#Footnote_GP" class="fnanchor">[GP]</a> curved inwards and upwards;
in this way she approaches the part where she
designs to deposit the egg; and suspending herself for a few
seconds before it, suddenly darts upon it and leaves the egg
adhering to the hair; she hardly appears to settle, but merely
touches the hair with the egg <i>held out on the projected point of
the abdomen</i>.<a href="#Footnote_GP" class="fnanchor">[GP]</a> The egg is made to adhere by means of a
glutinous liquor secreted with it. She then leaves the horse
at a small distance, and prepares a second egg, and poising
herself before the part, deposits it in the same way. The
liquor dries, and the egg becomes firmly glued to the hair:
this is repeated by these flies till four or five hundred eggs
are sometimes placed on one horse."</p>

<p>Mr. Clark farther tells us, that the fly is careful to select
a part of the skin which the horse can easily reach with his
tongue, such as the inside of the knee, or the side and back
part of the shoulder. It was at first conjectured, that the
horse licks off the eggs thus deposited, and that they are by
this means conveyed into its stomach; but Mr. Clark says,
"I do not find this to be the case, or at least only by
accident; for when they have remained on the hair four or
five days, they become ripe, after which time the slightest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
application of warmth and moisture is sufficient to bring
forth, in an instant, the latent larva. At this time, if the
tongue of the horse touches the egg, its operculum is thrown
open, and a small, active worm is produced, which readily
adheres to the moist surface of the tongue, and is thence
conveyed with the food to the stomach." He adds, that &ldquo;a
horse which has no ova deposited on him may yet have botts,
by performing the friendly office of licking another horse
that has.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_GQ" id="FNanchor_GQ"></a><a href="#Footnote_GQ" class="fnanchor">[GQ]</a> The irritations produced by common flies
(<i>Anthomyiæ meteoricæ</i>, <span class="smcap">Meigen</span>) are alleged as the incitement
to licking.</p>

<p>The circumstance, however, of most importance to our
purpose, is the agitation and terror produced both by this
fly and by another horse breeze-fly (<i>Gasterophilus hæmorrhoidalis</i>,
<span class="smcap">Leach</span>), which deposits its eggs upon the lips of
the horse as the sheep breeze-fly (<i>&OElig;strus ovis</i>) does on that
of the sheep. The first of these is described by Mr. Clark
as &ldquo;very distressing to the animal, from the excessive
titillation it occasions; for he immediately after rubs his
mouth against the ground, his fore-feet, or sometimes against
a tree, with great emotion; till, finding this mode of defence
insufficient, he quits the spot in a rage, and endeavours to
avoid it by galloping away to a distant part of the field, and
if the fly still continues to follow and teaze him, his last
resource is in the water, where the insect is never observed
to pursue him. These flies appear sometimes to hide themselves
in the grass, and as the horse stoops to graze they
dart upon the mouth or lips, and are always observed to poise
themselves during a few seconds in the air, while the egg is
prepared <i>on the extended point of the abdomen</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_GR" id="FNanchor_GR"></a><a href="#Footnote_GR" class="fnanchor">[GR]</a></p>

<p>The moment the second fly just mentioned touches the
nose of a sheep, the animal shakes its head and strikes the
ground violently with its fore-feet, and at the same time
holding its nose to the earth, it runs away, looking about on
every side to see if the flies pursue. A sheep will also smell
the grass as it goes, lest a fly should be lying in wait, and if
one be detected, it runs off in terror. As it will not, like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
horse or an ox, take refuge in the water, it has recourse
to a rut or dry dusty road, holding its nose close to the
ground, thus rendering it difficult for the fly to get at the
nostril.</p>

</div>

<p>When the egg of the ox breeze-fly (<i>Hypoderma bovis</i>, <span class="smcap">Latr.</span>)
is hatched, it immediately (if Mr. Bracey Clark be correct)
burrows into the skin; while, according to Réaumur, it is
hatched there. At all events, the grub is found in a bump
on the animal&rsquo;s back, resembling a gall on a tree,&mdash;&ldquo;a
place,&rdquo; says Réaumur, &ldquo;where food is found in abundance,
where it is protected from the weather, where it enjoys at
all times an equal degree of warmth, and where it finally
attains maturity.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_GS" id="FNanchor_GS"></a><a href="#Footnote_GS" class="fnanchor">[GS]</a> When in an advanced stage, the bumps
appear much like the swellings produced upon the forehead by
a smart blow. These, with the grubs, are represented in the
foregoing figure, and also at page 434.</p>

<p>Every bump, according to Réaumur, has in its inside a
cavity, which is a lodging proportionate to the size of the
insect. The bump and cavity also increase in proportion to
the growth of the grub. It is not until about the middle
of May that these bumps can be seen full grown. Owing
to particular circumstances, they do not all attain an equal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
size. The largest of them are sixteen or seventeen lines in
diameter at their base, and about an inch high; but they are
scarcely perceptible before the beginning or during the
course of the winter.</p>

<span class="fig_caption">Fly, maggot, and grub of the Ox breeze-fly, with a microscopic view of the maggot.</span>
</div>

<p>It is commonly upon young cattle, such, namely, as are
two or three years old, that the greatest number of bumps
is found; it being rare to observe them upon very old animals.
The fly seems to be well aware that such skins will not
oppose too much resistance, and seems to know, also, that
tender flesh is the most proper for supplying good nourishment
to its progeny. &ldquo;And why,&rdquo; asks Réaumur, &ldquo;should not
the instinct which conducts it to confide its eggs to the flesh
of certain species only, lead it to prefer the flesh of animals
of the same species which is most preferable?&rdquo; The number
of bumps which are found upon a beast is equal to the number
of eggs which have been deposited in its flesh; or, to
speak more correctly, to the number of eggs which have succeeded,
for apparently all are not fertile; but this number is
very different upon different cattle. Upon one cow only
three or four bumps may be observed, while upon another
there will appear from thirty to forty. They are not always
placed on the same parts, nor arranged in the same manner:
commonly, they are near the spine, but sometimes upon or
near the thighs and shoulders. Sometimes they are at remote
distances from each other; at other times they are so near
that their circumferences meet. In certain places, three or
four tumors may be seen touching each other; and more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
than a dozen sometimes occur arranged as closely together
as possible.</p>

<p>It is very essential to the grub that the hole of the tumor
should remain constantly open; for by this aperture a communication
with the air necessary for respiration is preserved;
and the grub is thence placed in the most favourable
position for receiving air. Its spiracles for respiration,
like those of many other grubs, are situated immediately
upon the posterior extremity of the body. Now, being almost
always placed in such a situation as to have this part above,
or upon a level with the external aperture, it is enabled to
respire freely.<a name="FNanchor_GT" id="FNanchor_GT"></a><a href="#Footnote_GT" class="fnanchor">[GT]</a></p>

<p>We have not so many examples of galls of this kind as
we have of vegetable galls; and when we described the
surprising varieties of the latter, we did not perceive that
it was essential to the insects inhabiting them to preserve
a communication with the external air: in the galls of trees,
openings expressly designed or kept free for the admission
of air are never observed. Must the grub, then, which
inhabits the latter have less need of respiring air than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
grub of the breeze-flies in a flesh-gall? Without doubt, not;
but the apertures by which the air is admitted to the inhabitants
of the woody gall, although they may escape our notice,
in consequence of their minuteness, are not, in fact, less real.
We know that, however careful we may be in inserting a
cork into a glass, the mercury with which it is filled is not
sheltered from the action of the air, which weighs upon the
cork; we know that the air passes through, and acts upon
the mercury in the tube. The air can also, in the same way,
penetrate through the obstruction of a gall of wood, though
it have no perceptible opening or crack; but the air cannot
pass in this manner so readily through the skins and membranes
of animals.</p>

<p>In order to see the interior of the cavity of an animal
gall, Réaumur opened several, either with a razor or a pair
of scissors; the operation, however, cannot fail to be painful
to the cow, and consequently renders it impatient under the
process. The grub being confined in a tolerably large
fistulous ulcer, a part of the cavity must necessarily be filled
with pus or matter. The bump is a sort of cautery, which
has been opened by the insect, as issues are made by caustic:
the grub occupies this issue, and prevents it from closing.
If the pus or matter which is in the cavity, and that which is
daily added to it, had no means of escaping, each tumor
would become a considerable abscess, in which the grub
would perish; but the hole of the bump, which admits the
entrance of the air, permits the pus or matter to escape;
that pus frequently mats the hairs together which are above
the small holes, and this drying around the holes acquires a
consistency, and forms in the interior of the opening a kind
of ring. This matter appears to be the only aliment allowed
for the grub, for there is no appearance that it lives, like the
grubs of flesh-flies, upon putrescent meat. Mandibles,
indeed, similar to those with which other grubs break their
food, are altogether wanting. A beast which has thirty,
forty, or more of these bumps upon its back, would be in a
condition of great pain and suffering, terrible indeed in the
extreme, if its flesh were torn and devoured by as many large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
grubs; but there is every appearance that they do not at all
afflict, or only afflict it with little pain. For this reason
cattle most covered with bumps are not considered by the
farmer as injured by the presence of the fly, which generally
selects those in the best condition.</p>

<p>A fly, evidently of the same family with the preceding,
is described in Bruce&rsquo;s &lsquo;Travels,&rsquo; under the name of zimb, as
burrowing during its grub state in the hides of the elephant,
the rhinoceros, the camel, and cattle. &ldquo;It resembles,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;the gad-fly in England, its motion being more sudden
and rapid than that of a bee. There is something peculiar
in the sound or buzzing of this insect; it is a jarring noise
together with a humming, which as soon as it is heard all the
cattle forsake their food and run wildly about the plain till
they die, worn out with fatigue, fright, and hunger. I have
found,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;some of these tubercles upon almost every
elephant and rhinoceros that I have seen, and attribute
them to this cause. When the camel is attacked by this fly,
his body, head, and legs break out into large bosses, which
swell, break, and putrefy, to the certain destruction of the
creature.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_GU" id="FNanchor_GU"></a><a href="#Footnote_GU" class="fnanchor">[GU]</a> That camels die under such symptoms, we do
not doubt; but we should not, without more minutely-accurate
observation, trace all this to the breeze-fly.</p>

<p>MM. Humboldt and Bonpland discovered, in South America,
a species, probably of the same genus, which attacks
man himself. The perfect insect is about the size of our
common house-fly (<i>Musca domestica</i>), and the bump formed
by the grub, which is usually on the belly, is similar to that
caused by the ox breeze-fly. It requires six months to come
to maturity; and if it is irritated it eats deeper into the flesh,
sometimes causing fatal inflammations.</p>


<p class="caption3 smcap">Grub Parasite in the Snail.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1829, we discovered in the hole of a
garden-post, at Blackheath, one of the larger grey snail shells
(<i>Helix aspersa</i>, <span class="smcap">Muller</span>), with three white soft-bodied grubs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
burrowing in the body of the snail. They evidently, from
their appearance, belonged to some species of beetle, and we
carefully preserved them in order to watch their economy.
It appeared to us that they had attacked the snail in its
stronghold while it was laid up torpid for the winter;
for more than half of the body was already devoured. They
constructed for themselves little cells attached to the inside
of the shell, and composed of a sort of fibrous matter, having
no distant resemblance to shag tobacco, both in form and
smell, and which could be nothing else than the remains of
the snail&rsquo;s body. Soon after we took them, appearing to
have devoured all that remained of the poor snail, we
furnished them with another, which they devoured in the
same manner. They formed a cocoon of the same fibrous
materials during the autumn, and in the end of October
appeared in their perfect form, turning out to be <i>Drilus
flavescens</i>, the grub of which was first discovered in France
in 1824. The time of their appearance, it may be remarked,
coincides with the period when snails become torpid. (J. R.)</p>

<p>In the following autumn, we found a shell of the same
species with a small pupa-shaped egg deposited on the lid.
From this a caterpillar was hatched, which subsequently
devoured the snail, spun a cocoon within the shell, and
was transformed into a small moth (of which we have not
ascertained the species) in the spring of 1830.</p>

<p>[Before concluding the account of the parasite insects, it
will be necessary to mention two of our British Ichneumonidæ,
which not only deposit their eggs in the larvæ of
other insects, but make for themselves cells of very beautiful
structure. In the accompanying illustration are shown the
cells of one of our commonest and most useful ichneumonidæ
(<i>Microgaster glomeratus</i>), together with the insect itself. At
Fig. 1<i>a</i> (<a href="#Page_438">p. 438</a>) is shown the little insect of the natural size,
and the same is given at 1 much magnified.</p>

<p>This creature lays its eggs in the body of the cabbage
caterpillar, forty or fifty eggs being deposited in the same
larva. They soon hatch into little transparent grubs, which
lie under the skin, and live on the fatty parts of the caterpillar,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
which continues to grow, and seems to thrive, whereas
its bulk is largely made up of the ichneumon larvæ.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 435px;">
<img src="images/438.png" width="435" height="218" alt="" />
<span class="fig_caption">Microgaster glomeratus.</span>
</div>

<p>After the caterpillar ceases from feeding, it crawls aside
for the purpose of assuming the pupal state. But, before it
can do so, the ichneumon larvæ, which have also ceased
from feeding, burst their way through the sides of the caterpillar,
and immediately begin to spin their cocoon. These
are oval, very small, and covered with yellow silk. A group
of these cocoons is shown at Fig. 3. The innumerable fibres
of these cocoons hamper the caterpillars so much that, in
most cases, it seldom is able to stir from the spot, but dies in
the midst of its enemies. Groups of these yellow cocoons
can be found in every wall or paling near cabbage gardens.
In a few days, the larvæ have passed through their pupal
stage, assuming the winged state, and emerge from the cocoons
through little circular doors, as seen in Fig. 2.</p>

<p>Our second illustration represents another species, <i>Microgaster
alveolarius</i>, together with its cocoons. As before, the
insect is shown of its natural size at la, and magnified at 1.
The preliminary life of this insect is exactly the same as that
of the preceding; but, instead of making a number of independent
and separate cocoons, the insects spin so closely together
that they form an edifice very much resembling a bee-comb.
Fig. 5 represents one of these cell-groups of the
natural size, and the edge of another group is shown at Fig. 4.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
A longitudinal section, slightly enlarged, is given at 3, in
order to show the hexagonal shape assumed by the aggregated
cells; and Fig. 2 shows the little lids which open to
give egress to the insect. All these figures are drawn from
specimens in my collection.]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_X" id="Footnote_X"></a><a href="#FNanchor_X"><span class="label">[X]</span></a> In the Mag. of Nat. Hist. 1839, p. 458, Mr. Shuckard gives
an account of the nest of a wasp, which he regards as _Vespa
Britannica_,&mdash;remarkable for the material of which it was constructed,
and for the locality in which it was found. This nest, which was
exhibited at a meeting of the Entomological Society, was found near
Croydon, built in a sparrow&rsquo;s nest, and attached to the
lining feathers. &ldquo;The smallness of the nest,&rdquo; says Mr. Shuckard, &ldquo;and also
of the tier of cells, as well as the peculiar material of which it appeared composed,
led to a discussion, the tendency of which seemed to support the opinion
that it was most probably the nest of a <i>Polistes</i>, a social-wasp not yet found
in this country, but if not of <i>Polistes</i>, certainly not yet determined or known.&rdquo;
The nest was ovate, about an inch and a half long, with a tier of cells internally,
originating from a common pedicle. It appeared to be constructed &ldquo;of the
agglutinated particles of a soft white wood, probably willow, very imperfectly
triturated;&rdquo; whence it had externally a rough granulated appearance. It was
sprinkled with black specks, arising perhaps from the intermixture of more
decayed portions of the wood; and was of a very fragile texture. &ldquo;The nature
of the material, and its unfinished execution, as well as the situation in which
it was found, appear to me to be its own peculiarities, and I must necessarily
consider it merely an accidental variation in material and locality from the usual
nests of the <i>Vespa Britannica</i> of Leach.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_BO" id="Footnote_BO"></a><a href="#FNanchor_BO"><span class="label">[BO]</span></a> It is justly remarked by Réaumur, that when caterpillars are left
at liberty among their native plants, it is only by lucky chance they
can be observed building their cocoons, because the greater number
abandon the plants upon which they have been feeding, to spin up in
places at some distance. In order to see their operations, they must
be kept in confinement, particularly in boxes with glazed doors,
where they may be always under the eye of the naturalist. In such
circumstances, however, we may be ignorant what building materials we
ought to provide them with for their structures. A red caterpillar,
with a few tufts of hair, which Réaumur found in July feeding upon
the flower bunches of the nettle, and refusing to touch the leaves,
began in a few days to prepare its cocoon, by gnawing the paper lid
of the box in which it was placed. This, of course, was a material
which it could not have procured in the fields, but it was the nearest
in properties that it could procure; for, though it had the leaves
and stems of nettles, it never used a single fragment of either. When
Réaumur found that it was likely to gnaw through the paper lid of the
box, and might effect its escape, he furnished it with bits of rumpled
paper, fixed to the lid by means of a pin; and these it chopped down
into such pieces as it judged convenient for its structure, which
it took a day to complete. The moth appeared four weeks after, of a
brownish-black colour, mottled with white, or rather grey, in the
manner of lace.</p>

<p>Bonnet also mentions more than one instance in which he observed
caterpillars making use of paper, when they could not procure other
materials.</p>

<p>The unmatched opening quote on <a href="#Page_12">page 12</a> was  assumed to be a
typographical error and removed. Where a sequential series of
paragraphs have an opening bracket without a closing one, these
were standardized to one opening and one closing bracket for the
whole section. One opening bracket missing on <a href="#Page_38">page 38</a> was assumed to
belong at the start of last line of that paragraph. The closing quote
from the second paragraph on <a href="#Page_47">page 47</a> was added. An Internet search
confirmed this location.</p>

<p>Where the footnotes originally stated &ldquo;Ibid.&rdquo;, the source of the
previous footnote was inserted.</p>

<p>The cover image was derived from an image made available on The Internet
Archive and is placed in the Public Domain.</p>
